The first time I was there was on a Saturday, early afternoon in Spring.  I found it strange that I was the only one in the store for about 20 minutes, until another customer came in.  Melrose is usually a pretty happening place during the Spring before summer temps hit.  I saw a lot of nice 1960s furniture, mostly living room sets and home decor.  Prices were on the high end for, let's face it folks, used furniture. The blonde lady who came out to greet me after I made it to their second room (there are 3 rooms total) was frazzled and preoccupied with eating her lunch. So I went back again last week.  Didn't see the frazzled lady from before but a mid-age hipster guy at the counter who didn't have the time to greet me (sorry I disrupted your cell phone surfing).  Yep.  I was the ONLY person in the store and you obviously ignored me.  

It's just an unwelcoming place.  So much potential, but the attitude there is less than acceptable.  Will spend my $$$ elsewhere.","2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ",1,"2014-07-08",1,"review",0

After going in a bunch of places I can say that I really love this store and cant wait to use them to stage my newest listing in a few months at 24th and Indian School.

Let me know if you need help finding a cool house with character to put your amazing finds from Modern on Melrose.

First, the service has been excellent and friendly. We're new to the mcm scene and didn't get snubbed at for not being ""in the know"" -- sadly, this was a welcome relief. 

Second, the selection is good. Yeah, it's always a hunt, but at MOM you aren't going to be sifting through, basically, garbage to find your treasures. With most of the weeding done for you, the store is a much nicer visit.","2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ",4,"2015-01-13",0,"review",0

My boyfriend and I went along with my parents (who love mid century modern furniture) just to look as I am moving soon and can't buy any furniture until I relocate, but this shop made me want to move to downtown Phoenix and fill my house with everything in this shop. My thrift-genius parents taught me to buy antique furniture and never ever ever buy new, as new furniture is expensive to buy and cheaply made. Modern on Melrose is fantastic proof of this - my boyfriend fell in love with a yellow leather and wood 70s couch and noticed that this beautiful couch cost less than a couch our friend recently bought at IKEA. And no one is going to buy IKEA couches in antique stores 40 years from now, because they barely last 1 move. 

Everything in this store is gorgeous and there is a great variety of furniture and random decor goods. We ended up buying some great stacking canisters as a gift, and the very helpful employee dashed back to the area we got them and told us they were 40% off. We debated keeping the canisters because they were as affordable as they were quirky and useful and interestingly designed, but the Christmas spirit prevailed and we decided to give them to their original recipient.

The same employee discussed style and furniture things with my father in a very helpful and absolutely non pretentious way, which is a refreshing and fun element of any antique store. I always want to talk to the employees but very often feel they are too busy or want to sound smarter than me (which they are, but I'm not buying anything if the person I'm giving money to makes me feel stupid). I was very struck by how open and helpful the employee was. Great experience. Great selection. Great prices.","2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ",5,"2014-12-22",0,"review",1

I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror. 

I was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say ""If you're going to start a sale, finish it!"" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store. 

As I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, ""Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!"" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said ""Bitch!"" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe. 

It is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service. 

Today was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.","2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ",1,"2013-11-17",4,"review",2

If you are looking for awesome vintage furniture in good shape this is the place to go. They know their stuff. A lot of awesome lamps and boomerang coffee tables. It is a must visit.

The store is very well curated unlike many other vintage/antique shops. I spent a few minutes looking around (I don't like to be bothered right away when I come in to a store). Cynthia greeted me warmly and I asked her to help me pick out some bedroom furniture. She asked me about my style preferences and showed me around. She noted what I liked and didn't like and made informed recommendations. It took me all of ten minutes to pick out the furniture I wanted. Cynthia actually asked me if I wanted to take some time to consider my purchase (not pushy at all!) and I told her I loved everything and I wanted to take delivery as soon as possible.

I then asked Cynthia to help me find a pair of lamps for the bed side tables I purchased. This time around I wasn't really loving anything but she took the time again to show me around and listen to my input. 

Another reviewer mentioned that their pieces are pricy and that could not be further from the truth. I had found some lower end shops that did not have the quality I was looking for and I also found some very high end shops. Modern on Melrose has excellent prices and the quality to back it up. I was pleasantly surprised by the value they provide.

I was able to have my furniture delivered the next day and I'm loving my new (old) furniture. I highly recommend you check them out!","2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ",5,"2014-08-23",0,"review",0

Okay, if you are a girl and looking for clothes here, I'd say pass. Unless of course you have a tiny waste and are maybe a size 0-4 on a good day.

But I went recently...and I just didn't like it. Sure, these are collectible pieces, goregous condition, the space is well cared for, I don't expect to afford these museum worthy pieces, especially at 11grand for a chair and ottoman (oh god, I hope the ottoman was included in that price....), but the affordable pieces of bracelets, earrings, clothing...um, it was a lot of the same items I saw here over a year ago...actually more like TWO years ago.....so, the inventory isn't very turnovering or fresh...so I guess Mint isn't so fresh?

Overall, I was underwhelmed, I didn't feel particularly welcomed either time I was here, and the stock continues to center on polyster 70s clothing and BCBG tops (?) making an uneven style feel and chilly ambiance.

In response to Sara U, you really have nothing to worry about for getting 5 gallons of E85.  Your car is already running on 5-10% ethanol every time you fill up with unleaded.  I wouldn't do it on a regular basis, but it is not like you put diesel in a gas vehicle or vise versa.   Just fill up with regular unleaded, then have somebody clear your check engine light for you.  It will probably throw a code about the O2 sensor, not because it is broken, but because the oxygen content of the E85 is higher.  It shouldn't come back on.  And no, I don't work there.

Stopped for lunch on a Saturday.

The lady got a cheeseburger and fries, I got scrod and broccoli, we split an order of their fried pickles as an app.
The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection.
They got the spears vs. chips decision right!

The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare, but happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share! 
 
And here's the kicker they were under four bucks! 

Kudos Mr. Pickle; you done good!

The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly, with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior, ... the fry guy here knows his craft!
And the burger was good as well.. ...typical of the genre.  

I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger.

The scrod was a very generous sized portion, nicely caramelized and served with lemon and butter and perfectly done.
When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered, it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share.
My dinner came with a salad, which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce, but rather freshly cut romaine, a cuke slice or two, carrot shreds and tomato, and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and butter.

The service was quite good, although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended, but that's a management issue, not the server's fault.

Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book, and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal, the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented!
I'm all for efficiency, especially when it affects how quickly I can get out of a restaurant.

That move garnered the fifth star!

Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day. There was a deli, but it opened at fucking 11! Who even wants to go to a deli after 11? Weak. Breezed through Peninsula. Winking Lizard? Bah. Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.

Cozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men.

OMG, when were going up there are beautiful gold deposit boxes all around then you hit the patio/seating area and you get a great view of the strip AND the pirate show..feels  like the fireworks are going to hit you haha.

You def wont regret it, I ordered the Khotan Beef plate and it was actually good! I wish it did have a little more but I was full forsure. My boyfriend had the Orange chicken plate I believe and he enjoyed that plate as well although he did wish he had more food on there...just b/c hes def a fattie. haha

I wouldn't say the food was bad, but it wasn't good.  I think the best word to describe it would be: amateurish.  It would be hard to believe that they had real sushi chefs in the kitchen, or that they used high quality fish.  Some of the fish didn't taste like anything!  No taste!

The service was pretty good, but our waiter didn't seem to know much about fish.

Don't waste your money on the Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer.  I don't know how anyone could have the nerve to charge $22 for 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi (if it even was Hamachi) on a chip.  The Tuna Tartare wasn't that great either...  I've had better hors d'oeuvres at weddings.

The concept of the Salmon Parmesan roll sounded good, but when eating it, the Parmesan didn't make sense.  I was in the mood for noodles, so we also ordered the Crab Lo Mein.

The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes. A++ for effort there.

We were seated outside and it was  a nice night.  But, seriously, that Sirens show is craptastic and if you're not a fan, sit inside.

We ordered Khotan lobster, chicken lo mein, brown rice, and a tempura platter.  The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great, but, gasp, it's $36. The chicken lo mein was ""eh,"" very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked. The tempura platter was delicious but anything fried always is.

Pros:
- nice patio with misters and adequate seating.  Good location to see the show (even if the show is GOD AWFUL- but I won't rate this place according to the show.  My eyes were bleeding after watching it.)
- decent variety of food selections and full bar
- decor and ambience were pretty nice

Cons:
- food was overpriced for the quality.  I had the Teriyaki chicken, which was dry.  California Roll appetizer was dry and fell apart.  The lettuce wraps were decent appetizers, as was the tempura platter.  We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed.  
- service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way.

The sliders were pretty darn tasty with a side of pickled ginger that our server recommended. The Tom Yum was really good too. The asparagus came out ice cold. They brought us another one, but it still wasn't great hot. The coating is way too thick. We all agreed that they use Rice Krispies for the ""fry.""

For dinner, we ordered the Pad Thai (awesome), Khotan beef (decent), and crispy walnut shrimp. All of us like walnut shrimp from Ping Pang Pong and China Mama. We were expecting it to be hot. It was cold. Apparently, that's the way they serve this dish - fried cold shrimp. Once we knew, it wasn't that bad on the bed of vinegary salad. Just wasn't what we were expecting.

Our dessert of mini-cupcakes was comped. The worst cupcakes I've ever had. Three cupcakes - mango, coconut and chocolate, each with their own sauce. I really, really wanted to like them. They didn't taste fresh and were too cold. The cake wasn't fluffy and was really dense. 

The restaurant is beautiful. Worth a try. Don't expect miracles.","4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A",3,"2011-01-08",1,"review",0

No skinny Cambodian-looking girl would have an ass that sticks out ten inches from her back unless she stuck a basketball in there, seriously.  Then she told us to go upstairs because that's where the real restaurant is at and we were again greeted by another Asian hostess. While walking upstairs, you would feel like you're in a bank's safe box room because seriously, that's what it looks like, no joke.  Fun to play with, but weird.  Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? 

The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.  As long as its good, I like it.  

I liked how our waiter came back to refill my friend's drink a couple times without being asked.  I like attentiveness.  I like staffs who pretends to be genuine as good as they're faking it.  Having missed our menus for the first ten minutes, the service is above average.

More importantly, there a few restaurants in Las Vegas that offer a more impressive atmosphere.  Anyone comparing it to ""Panda Express"" or even ""PF Changs"" is simply not doing this place justice.  The modern and sleek decor hasn't changed too much from the days it was Social House except for the fact they have added some stunning jade and ivory sculptures on display.

Most importantly, the food presentation, taste and service are well beyond expectations for a ""reasonably"" priced restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip.

Can you get Asian food as good or better at a lower price down the street (Spring Mountain) in Las Vegas Chinatown?  Yes, of course, but no where near the same dining experience in terms of location, seating (indoor/outdoor), ambiance, and cool vibe.

I would challenge some of those that previously rated this place less than 4 to give it another try.  Unless you are a complete foodie-snob and/or have no clue what a ""normal"" price is for a Las Vegas Strip restaurant, it will be difficult to rate this dining experience lower than a 4.

"87",0,"OpAfXeNL4kJA59PoUFU7ew","yfF0bUmR65iOGw0QefGSPA","My four stars are for the lounge area and the food.  The service in the dining area was lame.

The lounge was great.  During happy hour (5-7PM) there are drink and app specials. And since ISLA was packed to the gills, my fella and I decided to check out Khotan.  The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game. 

We were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner.

The dining area is upstairs.  Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers. Pretty impressive.  Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio.  The inside of the restaurant was dark.  Not mood-making-romantic dark.  More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark. Oh well.

We ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup.  The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken.  My one gripe about the soup...there were pieces of fried scallion (or something...I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat.  I ended up picking it out of my soup.

The pad thai was to die for. Super tasty and a really great portion.  I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) - but hey, it's Vegas baby.  My fella loved the singapore style noodles.  He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy.

We enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito. (Give me anything with Canton in it and I'm set. Yum.) 

So - let's talk about the service. The servers were polite and great when we saw them.  We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes. This could have definitely had to do with the fact that for a while we were the only ones inside the dining area, but the servers never acknowledged the crap service.  A simple, ""Sorry 'bout the wait"" would have sufficed.  Oh well.

Good thing the food is so good. I'm dreamin about that pad thai. Mmmmm...","4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A",4,"2010-11-02",1,"review",1

For appetizer we had the crispy asparagus. It was just japanese crackers deepfried around asparagus. Too weird of a texture but okay to eat. Only 6 sticks. So to me, 6 asparagus heads is not worth that price.

I got the lobster curry. Again, for the price, it was not worth. i can get thai green curry for $5.95 down the street and throw in some steamed lobster and get the same effect. 

hubby got korubuta pork chop. okay, but have had much better elsewhere.

the place is also really dark, to the point where you cannot read your menu. you have to put the menu an inch away from the candle on your table. lame.

I came back another time for a company dinner (my suggestion, woo!) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables. We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied.

I've come back several times since, in much smaller groups. Unfortunately, the chefs never perform or make a spectacle for smaller parties only the large groups, pretty disappointing. Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times.

It's also not really that cheap given the portions. Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward!

As other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat you with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show/dinner. Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.

Our chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).

Half way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).

We really had a great evening here. I highly recommend Toyo if you're in the mood for a fantastic dinner and a show.","7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ",5,"2012-03-07",3,"review",3

I agree with another reviewer, if you're in a rush, it's not the place for you. And it is awkward to sit with a bunch of people you don't know. However, more often than not, my fiancé and I are seated at a table alone which is nice. 

Considering the portions, this place isn't that expensive. It is one of the only restaurants where my fiancé doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later. Our bill (with tax but no tip) usually comes out to $115. This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon).  

In terms of the ""show"" aspect, I'm not a huge fan of this. I have only experienced chefs who really put on a show when dining with large groups. But this, for me, is a positive.

Should have just had the nachos as that was a meal in itself. If you have ever had Big Dogs' nachos you know what I am talking about. The order is so big, it would easily feed four or so. We asked them for a half order and still it was a huge portion. They layer the cheese in between the chips and pile on the sour cream, jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes and guacamole. You can add meat like chicken, taco seasoned beef, or shredded beef for just a little bit more. 

Once they have it all together under the salamander it goes and it's heated all the way through. So the chips on the bottom are just as warm, crunchy and smothered in cheese as the ones in the middle and on top. 

My bratzel is a hamburger with bacon, bratwurst sausage, crispy thin rings of onion, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and of course the pretzel roll. Cut this baby up into four's it's enormous.

I had the fish sandwich with garlic fries. The fried fish was good and you get 2 large fillets on the bun. It comes with tartar sauce and fries but you can get garlic or sweet potato fries for $1 more. I always get the sweet potato waffle fries and they are worth the extra buck. 

The service is never bad and the beer is always cold. They really didn't do anything in particular to loose a star. I'm just at a loss with the indoor smoking.

The beer is brewed at the Draft House location on Rancho, but its just as fresh here.  In fact, when the special brews run out at the Draft House, you can often find them here or at the Nellis location for another week or two.

The bar food is good too.  The menu is slightly different, but pretty much the same as the Draft House.  The only thing is that sometimes the restaurant has slow service on weekends.  This never used to be a problem, but lately when I have gone it has been.  However, after a few Dirty Dog IPA's, this is easily forgiven.  

Try the cheese curds, and the philly cheese steak sandwich.  The fries are awesome too.

Pair any of these cold drafts with one of their monster burgers and satisfaction is sure to ensue.

With a side of their sweet potato fries for an additional $1 hit the spot. Although the fries were cold, the burger more than made up for it.

I ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich on foccacia, which came with roasted peppers, mozzarella, and yum, sauteed spinach and garlic.  It would have been outstanding if they'd only heated the foccacia to crisp it up.  Instead of the fries or cole slaw, I sprang for the extra two bucks to change it up for a salad.  I expected a tiny side salad, but this was really big, with lots of chopped tomatoes, cuke, cheese, and romaine.  It was missing olives, but that was great:  I hate olives!  By the time I got halfway through the salad, I felt like I'd already eaten dinner.

My husband ordered the walleye special.  I thought it was pretty high-priced at $20, but it came with the aforementioned salad, plus two sides. But when they brought out the plate, I saw the reason for the high price: the piece of fish was absolutely monstrous.  It could have fed a small third-world nation, but my husband lives to eat, so he managed to devour half of it before throwing in the towel.  It became my dinner on Saturday night, and I thought it was fabulous!  I also appreciated the fact that it wasn't over-salted.  Next time we go we'll both order it, and we'll be able to eat for a week!

One of the other couples ordered the same as us.  The guy from the third couple had the burger with bratwurst and, I think, bacon, plus some kind of cheese.  He liked it a lot.  His wife wasn't feeling very well, so she just ordered some tuna salad on a plate.

I ended up with the sweet potato fries and they ended up being SWEET POTATO WAFFLE FRIES. Best sweet potato fries ever. Seriously. 

My ridiculous burger topped with a brat, and cheese, and onion strings, and bacon was amazing. I'm not sure if the burger meat itself was good because I was in topping heaven. I ate 1/3rd of it and was too full to continue. Insanely tasty and filling. My husband enjoyed his pulled pork sliders very much as well. 

I'm not sure how tasty their healthy food is (although the salads did sound damn good on the menu!), but their bar food is great - a nice change from the offerings at your typical PT's.","1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q",4,"2011-02-15",4,"review",5

Well it has been about two years since I was here last for a less than memorable dining experience. You know those times you have dined at an establishment and had great food then you boast to a friend on how good it was. Then you take that friend to eat there and it is a complete disaster and not good at all! Well that is what happened here about two years ago so that is why I have stayed away for so long.

This just goes to show that an establishment can change for the better or worse after time, in this case luckily was for the good! I know my fellow Yelper and good friend Karen is going to shake her head and laugh when she reads this review! lol You can also read her review from when she posted about our crappy horrific visit as well.

This was one of those nights where you want to dine out however can't decide on a place so this is where hubby and I ended up.

We got there late however the basketball game was still playing so our server invited us to take advantage of happy hour as she would honor it for us. So I got a whiskey and coke for $2 and my sweetie decided on a Dog's Draft choice beer for $2 to start our meal off!

Their special this Tuesday night 3-10pm only was a half slab of BBQ baby back ribs, coleslaw and fries for $9.95. I must admit this meal was finger licking good with the fall off of the bone rib meat. The coleslaw was sweet and delicious as well really complimenting this meal along with the great golden fries. It is a lot of food for the price making a great special that I would order again for sure!

My hubby decided on the Brewer's Sandwich, a johnsonville beer brat and a red Klement's smoked brat topped with grilled onions, sauerkraut & Swiss cheese on grilled rye with beer mustard. Served with garlic fries. His meal looked delicious and he really enjoyed it a lot!

We decided for dessert to share their Big Dog's Brownie Sundae a warm, gooey, homemade chocolate brownie, topped with  häagen dazs vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chopped peanuts. drizzled with hot fudge. It was very good!

The service was good as our server was friendly and attentive with a smiling face which made us feel comfortable.

I am happy to say the food we ordered on this visit was 100% better in quality, taste, portion and price then it was on the last visit!

We also took advantage of our coupon $10 off your check of $30 or more, so basically my $9.95 baby back rib dinner was free!","1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q",4,"2013-06-19",6,"review",7

They make their own beer, something that I've found to be pretty rare here in Vegas.  While most bars are offering you a choice of Bud, Bud Light or Coors, Big Dog's offers those PLUS about 8 of their awesome microbrews!  If you're a beer lover, you gotta try their IPA!  It's simply heavenly!  They usually have their regular IPA but once in a while they also offer War Dog, a knock-you-on-your-ass 9% alcohol imperial IPA!  It is SO GOOD but beware, as you really only need to drink one.  I would also recommend the stout and pale ale.  Skip the bizarre wheat beer... it tastes like root beer to me for some weird reason.  

Atmosphere in the place is pretty good for a sports bar with video poker machines.  The staff is friendly and they remember you.  Very high ceilings and good ventilation, so you won't come out smelling like smoke.  They also have good bar food- excellent fries, and I would highly reccommend the fish tacos.

Big Dogs is basically a PTs with microbrews with a cafe attached. You walk into the big Dog House. The bar area is 21 plus, it's smokey, and there are various video poker machines.
The restaurant is on the left half of the building. There is a section of hi-top seating which allows seating; the larger dining area is lined with booths and scattered tables. 

I've never had a bad meal here, ever. Even those that I didn't like that much were based on my own taste buds (I just don't like brats, never will). They offer up amazing soups and cheese curds. If you are feeling indulgent, order some of these bad boys. They are gooey cheesy, beer-battered perfection. Seriously, my mouth is watering as I type this.

Some of my go-to regulars are the Southwest Steak salad, the pulled pork sandwich, fish and chips, and grandma's pot roast. They offer fries, coleslaw, potato salad, or sweet potato fries. 

Service is always prompt and friendly. The place doesn't feel overly clean, but I think that has to do with the indoor smoking and dim lighting.

I was torn with this one. One part of me wanted to cradle this moist, flavorful, delicious sandwich as one would a hard-earned trophy, or a cherished heirloom. The other part of me wanted to shove the whole thing in my mouth at once, and just wallow in cheesy ecstasy. If I hadn't been heading to meeting with customers, I'd probably have ordered a second one just to rub all over myself, so that no part of me would have to miss out on this sandwich.

Having said that, the food here is better than expected.  I came here more for the selection of ""home-brewed"" beers and was not disappointed.  Especially because on Saturday nights they offer half-price pitchers and at $8 it's a good deal even for a single diner like myself.  They had a Baby Back Ribs special with a 1/3 rack of ribs plus coleslaw and sweet potato waffle fries for $8----can't beat the price.  The meat was very tender and fell off the bone and the sauce was not overpowering (it's a sweeter sauce if you like tangy instead).  I didn't try anything else because hey, it is a bar and casino!

First off, while it's probably not so, you just get the feeling that nothing in the place is clean.  It's old.  It shows no signs of renovation and thus the feeling of 25 years  (just a guess) of being open twenty-four hours a day catches up with the place.  As I have seen in other reviews, the smoke hanging in the air doesn't jibe well with an eating establishment.  I had it at 3 stars, but writing the review, I just can't give 3 (A ok) to a place where my clothes stink like smoke every time I spend an hour there.

Food positive:  Only place I know you can get a Bratzel (brat/burger combo on a pretzel bun)!  Food negative:  This place sort of touts itself as a Packer (ie Wisconsin) establishment but the cheese curds are terrible and covered in some sort of Parmesan cheese or something - gross - that's not how you serve cheese curds.

I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.

I was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.

I watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying ""Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!"".....she replied ""I know""......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!

This is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.

Back to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.

The Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.

I took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.

Will I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.","1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q",2,"2010-10-04",10,"review",6

I can't attest to the quality of the food, but the drinks weren't bad.  I do hate it when places don't charge on-the-dollar for drinks.

It has the same concept as Yorkdale and Eaton Centre, as they give you real cutlery and dishes as opposed to the plastic ones.  

Compared to Eaton Centre, and Yorkdale, this is a lot smaller, but there is still at least 20 places to choose from including some of the newer entries into the food court wars (Big Smoke Burger, Amaya Express, SU&SHI, Shanghai 360, Chipolte, Szechuan Express) plus the older ones (A&W, KFC, Manchu Work etc.).

Overall, it's not a bad place to eat if you are on your lunch, can't decide what to eat or are just hanging out at the mall, but not worth a special drive (it is a food court after all right?)

Also, compared to Yorkdale, there's no special sit down restaurants close to the food court besides Earl's.","3Phhm4suJ-9fVakKXJSMxg",3,"2013-09-08",6,"review",4

Good:  Use of actual stainless steal cutlery, melamine trays, bowls, cute condiment containers, cups, etc.  Newly renovated eateries, washrooms, seating. 

Bad:  Not enough seating, especially at peak times, considering the amount of eateries, and there aren't any visible garbage/recycling bins, so as a diner, you can either leave your tray/trash on the tables OR bring your tray to the station to have someone else clean up after you.  :(

This is not a good message to insinuate to shoppers.  Instead, I think Food Central should promote a more community-like attitude such as ""please clean up after yourself"" and set up different bins - similar to IKEA/Whole Foods - so that everyone can do their part!  

There are already enough lazy slobs out there, we don't need to raise a new generation of them.

I worked at Square One for several years back when I was in university and remember the food court quite well...it was my savior on the (many) occasions that I would forget to bring my lunch to work. How I didn't pack on twenty pounds at the time is beyond me. It was adequate back then, if pretty standard. Now with a lot of malls stepping up their game, it's nice to see that Square One has followed suit.

Everything has been redone and renovated and it has a nice and modern look, although it does look a little cold and sterile compared with how it used to. Lots of new places as well as the old, so there really is a good selection. It's still overpriced and often dull mall food but at least you have options. They've also made the switch to reusable cutlery and dishware, which is obviously great. 

All-in-all it's still a food court in a mall, but at least it's a pretty decent one with a lot of choices.

i had fairly high hopes for this place based on the yelp reviews id perused so i was very let down when it turned out that i had been mislead ...

first of all the good : the decor , if trying a little too hard to create a ""fine-dining"" type of atmosphere , is pleasant and i really liked the artwork on the walls featuring the nepalese (or indian ?) countryside .  the music was also nice traditional indian music .  the servers were very pleasant ; they kept their distance and didnt offer much banter but were kind , polite and attentive .

the bad :  THE FOOD !  after waiting quite a while in an empty restaurant to receive our order , we thought that maybe this was a good sign as some of our meal was being prepared ""fresh"" .  sadly this was not the case except maybe for the bindi masala which was slimy and undercooked .  the aloo gobi featured very hard cauliflower and stale tasting , dried out potatoes .  most disappointing was the butter chicken which was VERY tough and dry .  the sauce was not rich at all - definitely couldnt detect any butter and very little cream .  the tomatoes didnt lend any sweetness as they should but instead made the dish quite bitter .

the naan was okay .

if we hadnt had a discount through groupon , it would have felt like a complete rip-off .  the potions were VERY tiny and all four members of our party left very dissatisfied .

no offence to the other reviewers but im wondering if maybe the higher rating is partly due to the large student population in the area ; maybe this place is earning high praise from people who have little experience with indian food or what torontos competitive dining scene really has to offer ?","0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w",2,"2013-07-05",0,"review",0

Tried out dinner here last week for the first time. 

I find the menu slightly overpriced. Most of the curries were $15 and that did not include rice or naan. Given this is the ANNEX and the decor/ambiance of this place is quite underwhelming, I think they are overcharging by a few dollars. Other similar type places with much better food (Banjara) have a more reasonable price point.

My date and I ordered the Dinner for Two special ($36.99) which was definitely the most bang for your buck. You get a platter of tandoori chicken, boti kabob and chicken tikka (two pieces of each), a lamb curry, mutter paneer, peas pulav and 1 order of rice and 1 naan. Some kind of rice pudding for dessert too.

Food was pretty tasty, didn't blow my mind but was definitely good.

I split a non-vegetarian combo for 2 with my girlfriend and it was delicious.  In particular, the chicken from the tandoor was uncharacteristically juicy.  Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars.

The ambiance is where it looses a bit of cache for me.  There was a sort of awkward white guy playing a sitar in front of what must be the lunch-time buffet station.  There was just something about that scenario that screamed ""We're throwing the South Asian kitchen sink at you, what more could you want?  We have a sitar, Indian food, an inexpensive lunchtime buffet and waiters wearing bowties.""

They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them. 

The food is not bad per se, but it's pretty generic and forgettable. The Nepali portion of the menu is limited, and unfortunately the differences between the Indian and Nepali dishes were very minimal, for eg,: our server told us that the only difference between Bhuteko Cauli (Nepali Entree) and Aloo Ghobi (Indian Entree) was that the latter had potatoes in it! I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.

We ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.

The service was good except that they mixed up our order, but that was corrected in a jiffy.

Their food is excellent, really - especially during dinner time. Service is impeccable (they seriously make you feel like you're at a restaurant that would charge double the price) and prices are very reasonable.

The food at the lunch buffet is most likely just extra leftovers from the previous night so the tandoori chicken won't be as juicy and the naan not as fluffy/warm, but the curry is just as good. Either way, you can't get a better deal for $10.

""Last week I wrote a review for Mt. Everest Restaurant expressing mixed opinions on Mt Everest: high quality food but at the cost of poor service (Refer to bottom of this review).  Within a matter of days, I was surprised to have received an extremely apologetic response via Yelp from the owners of Mt. Everest Restaurant.  They apologized for the inconvenience they may have caused my party, informed me that the staff was briefed about the situation and that new staff has been consequently hired, and offered me a coupon for my friends and me.  

Although I have yet to go back (I'm pretty sure I would despite the disappointing service I faced the second time I went), I have decided to up the rating for the restaurant because I am entirely impressed by the fact that the restaurant owners are both concerned with and responsive to the opinions of their customers.""
---

I went back with a group of five friends to Mt. Everest after claiming the coupon.  As they had promised, the service was much improved--the service was fast and the meal was as expected delicious. I'm pretty sure they were unaware that I had previously complained on yelp about their terrible service, so I'm hoping that my experience was unbiased. With their improved service and same excellent quality of food, I am changing my review to five stars.

""Very very mixed opinions about this place.

1. The Food is amazing--both lunch buffet and dinner menu
2. The food is even better when the service isn't terribly slow.

After the first visit to Mt Everest for lunch buffet, I was utterly blown away by the quality of the food.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of selecting Mt Everest for a class dinner two weeks later.  We waited an hour and change for our orders to materialize; by then we were late for class.

The lunch buffet isn't the cheapest ever, but it's all-you-can-eat, so skip breakfast!  They are a lot more careful with food preparation for dinner (i.e. meat is boneless, selection is better) but you know what?  I get the lunch buffet anyway, since it's just so tasty.

We never manage to spend under $50, which is a shame since I'd like to incorporate this restaurant into daily life.

Okra is my favourite vegetable when it comes to Indian cuisine and I order it whenever I can. Mt Everest's bhindi masala over some uninspired rice left me satisfied (it's actually way better as reheated leftovers) and I enjoyed the nice spicy kick to it, but the garlic naan was flat out disappointing. I'm a bit of a garlic naan connoisseur and I am not quite sure what to even say about what I tried because there was not much to it. It wasn't garlicky in the slightest, not even buttery, and the naan's texture was dry, tasteless, and chewy in an unflattering way.

I am for sure willing to give Mt Everest a second shot because I walk past it all the time and would really like to try some of their other items, but first I need to recover from this meal that cost over $30 (two entrees, rice, and naan - really?) and a bit of an upset stomach.","0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w",3,"2009-10-26",1,"review",1

I ordered butter chicken, naan and drinks. The delivery was done in 30 minutes which is very good when compared to delivery times of other Indian restaurants. 

The food:

1. Butter Chicken: Delivery quantity was very small when compared to the actual dine-in quantity. The chicken tasted as if it was just put into the butter chicken gravy and served. We wouldn't have cared much if only the gravy tasted good. Being an Indian, I can easily differentiate good butter chicken from the rest. Unfortunately, this wasn't the best I have had in Toronto. 

3 out 5 stars.

2. Naan: The Naan was a horror story. It wasn't cooked well. I could taste the raw flour which made them inedible for us. Apart from that, the naan smelled very bad. 

0 out 5 stars.

One of the servers sat us down at a 'waiting' table in the front and said the table would be ready in about 20 minutes. He put down a couple of poppadums and then vanished. 35 minutes went by, the waiting area was getting pretty crowded. We were getting antsy by now. My friend went and found the guy and asked him for an update 'only 5 minutes sir!' OK..another 15 went by..my friend went again to look for the sever who (guess what) took one look at him and ran inside!! Meanwhile, even those waiting after of us were seated. We managed to find the floor manager who looked surprised that we'd been waiting for 1 hour plus. I had enough and said- look, either we sit asap or we can leave, to which he replied - not possible today...human error... I'd be happy to serve you another day...we waited for him to add the words 'on the house' or at least a measly 'at a discount' but NO! nothing...he just looked at us blankly.

we ordered the Non-Vegetarian Bhojan for two and to start we ordered the chicken momos.  so we had a mixture of indian and nepalese food.   the momos were absolutely deeeelicious.  they dough was cooked well (maybe slightly overdone, but if so just barely) so that it was soft and not overly chewy.  the filling inside was tender pieces of chicken and spinach i think.  that was very tangy, like it had soup inside or something.

then the waiter brought us one part of a our Bhojan.  that had a couple different kinds of chicken, like the tandoori, some boti kebab - which might have been beef or lamb, not sure.  the chicken was surprisingly tender and tasty in both forms.  the lamb/beef both in its form here and in the lamb curry to follow were overdone and too chewy, too rubbery.  what was to follow was the lamb curry, the mutter paneer, a raita and a couple of rice puddings for desert.

the sauces were pretty great, the accompanying veggies (though not substantial) were tasty, as they had absorbed the juices and accompanying sauces and spices of the meats.

the rice puddings were fine, tasty, but i dont think itd be my first pick of deserts in general.

all that was accompanied by 2 kingfisher beers a piece.  id like to come back here again, but id focus specifically on the nepalese dishes.","0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w",3,"2008-12-23",0,"review",0

What we ordered:
Momos
Jhane ko dal
Aloo tama bodi
Lamb Briyani
Raita

When asked how hot - we selected medium. Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour. We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat). They were right. The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day.

The food itself was cooked to perfection. The lamb was cooked enough to be ""cooked"" but still melt in your mouth soft.   Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce. The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good).

Even with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive! Which is rare for a unique dining experience downtown.

I give it 4 stars only because I have no base of reference to know if this is the best of the best of Nepalese food - but it was definately fantastic and I will be back again (and again and again).","0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w",4,"2013-03-13",1,"review",1

The Sitar player is quite good, but loud. Watch where they seat you, he may just be on break and then when the party gets started up again, boy are you in for a ear-ful.

Based on the positive reviews here for Mt Everest, and being that I've never had Nepalese food before, I pushed to give it a try. We only ordered some garlic naan, plain rice, and two entrees:

1. Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black beans in mountain spices)
2. Malai Kofta (Cottage Cheese with vegetables in a cashew sauce)

The dishes were both tasty! I really enjoyed the Aloo Tama Bodi's flavour, and the Malai Kofta was also delicious.

Additionally, I was happy with the amount of Naan and rice we received in a single order. There was more than enough to cover both dishes. The ratio of bread or rice needed to cover a dish at Mt Everest is clearly 1:1.

Which brings me to why my review is only 2 star. The portions! First of all, the Malai Kofta only came with about 3 small cubes of cheese. Both dishes came in small, unfilled containers (sadly Instagram deleted our photo evidence) and compared to Indian portions elsewhere (and the price) we were disappointed. 

Flavour-wise, I actually would recommend. However, it's likely that in-restaurant portions would be more significant and provide better value, so I wouldn't advise getting takeout.","0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w",2,"2014-01-06",0,"review",0

I've sampled a few items here and there on the menu, but I feel like it's hard to go wrong. Tikka masala tends to be a crowd pleaser, and I'd recommend the appetizer plate if you want to sample. Don't both with rice or dessert, though you may want naan to compensate for the spice. And again, although I try to be veg most times, I would say abandon any such intentions here and embrace the perfect succulence that is their meat dishes. 

Not a five though because it's a bit pricey yet fails to pull off the classy act (though it does try. E for effort?). Servers also tend to be a bit rude, which I can only ignore when prices are low enough to make me feel like I'm getting away with something.

Nevertheless, I will likely be back again when I am craving meat that is cooked as it should be.","0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w",4,"2013-06-08",1,"review",0

On weekends, even with a reservation we waited 20 minutes for a table for 2. we then sat at that table for 10 minutes before even getting a glass of water.

the food overall was quite good, from the apps to the mains, this would be a 4 star experience. 
but the service was brutal by being both unattentive and slow. honestly when the glasses on the table are empty, I expect someone to be taking my next drink order asap.

Definitely 5 stars for Maria, who I gather owns this place, as she was really nice and inviting.

Located on the northern side of Bell Road in a newer strip mall the outside looks very inviting.  As you walk in the decor is neatly situated and the atmosphere gets you excited for some possible good mexican food.  After your initial look around when walking in a little confusion may settle in. No one will greet you at the door and you wonder if you should wait to be sat or just seat yourself.  With more observation you'll notice a sign far away from the front door saying ""Please seat yourself.""  

So you look for a clean cozy table and seat yourself, which is not a big deal at all.  Next you have to wait for someone to give you a menu to see what they actually serve.  You would think that menus would arrive very shortly, but I found out that on two occasions it took upwards to five minutes for them to arrive.  I am an understanding person , I can see the place is busy,and I love mexican food so I patiently wait with a smile.

I could go and on about how long it took for my experiences here.  What I found out on two lunch visits that the owners are the servers as well.  No problem at all with this if you are good at what you do and are speedy.  However when each server has over a ten table section and can't get you in and out in a timely manner then it's time to hire some help.  Or maybe change your concept of the restaurant while having customers go to a window and order their food.

I'll remind you that the food is really good, but everything takes forever.  My recommendation is to try takeout.","29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A",3,"2010-02-22",1,"review",0

This is Halisco style food - not the same! Think of it as more of a gourmet style Mexican restaurant. And b) they ordered the chicken tacos. Admittedly, they sort of suck. I've been coming here with my family for years! After they moved across town to the new location, we followed.

Ambiance: It's a CUTE restaurant with an old town Mexican theme. Subdued lighting with eccentric and rich coloring.

Service: You are evil spawn if you don't like M&M. They work hard and are the loveliest people ever! They are friendly and remember you if you go there often enough. He looks angry but I swear he's super nice. She's so warm and welcoming and knows my order every time I go in.Thanks.

Food (and none of it is greasy!):
+ Pork chop/cube with green sauce: INCREDIBLE. OMYGOODNESS. They're soft. They're savory. They're moist. They couldn't be better. They make me want to sing my praises from the rooftops of Phoenix.
+ Chicken tacos: Skip them. They are kind of disappointing.
+ Chicken tortilla soup: AMAZING. Seriously. I have yet to find one that's better. It's spicyyy and will clear your sinuses! Mmm.
+ Refried beans: Fantastic. The best I've had, and believe me, I am well versed in Mexican food. If anyone knows beans, it's me.
+ Chips and salsa: The chips are freshly deep fried, so they're wonderful and crunchy. The salsa is great. One is chunky and mildly hot, while the other is super smooth and super hot. Both taste amazing.

When I walked in the door the first room was completely empty and there was a woman standing and staring at me. I turned to look at the sign and turned back around. She still said nothing. I asked if they were open and she said what did the sign say? I said it says open (but why the hell are you just staring at me like you are not). She finally says there is a large party coming in and to sit in the other room. I said sure. Both rooms are fairly small. The decor is pretty whack. Old office looking carpet and old booths. I'm a fan of tile in restaurants. Spilled food and drinks just don't come out of carpet and especially old office looking carpet. The tables are covered with that cheap vinyl red sticky covers that also never look or feel clean. The benches were old and had tears in them. There were 3 gentlemen in another booth and other than that the place was empty. 

We were brought menus and drinks fairly quickly but no salsa. Another couple came in and sat down after us and were given chips and salsa immediately. Our waitress came back and asked if were ready to order. Still no chips and salsa. About 15 minutes into our ""quick"" lunch we were finally given a small bowl of chips and a couple of salsa. The salsa was ok. Nothing special. Same for the chips. We placed our orders and in comes out in about another 10-15 minutes. 

I had the El Conquistador burrito. Its a pretty large burro filled with a chile relleno, steak picado, and guac. It was ok. Really nothing good or bad. For 7.50 I expect greatness in a burrito. The wife had a bean and cheese burro w/ enchilada sauce. They were very tight on the sauce and cheese. It was the overall theme of the place. Very tight. For extra chips and salsa it was 1.50 according to the menu. 

The waitress came by another 15-20 minutes later and asked how we were. I said we were ready to go now. She didn't take our plates and she didn't bring our bill. Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and walk to the man at the front and ask him if could pay him directly. Our waitress, who's now talking on the phone, with our dirty plates still on our tables and check no where to be found even after I asked for it, makes a statement to the man that I am ready to go. No b, I was ready to go 20 minutes ago when I told you I was done. Now I'm ready for an apron cause I've been here long enough to get paid. 

From the conversations I heard the man and woman own the place. Good for them. I wont be back and don't recommend anyone else going back. I saw a newspaper article on the wall that AZcentral or New Times recommended it as a top 10 Mexican restaurant in town. Maybe it was good before they moved to this location. Maybe they lost some key staff members. Maybe they know something I don't. I doubt it.","29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A",1,"2010-05-24",1,"review",1

I thought I would be a cooler Phoenician if I could make this my new ""my place."" 

Perhaps we hit on an off night (just a random Saturday), but our service was horrible. I was taking my neighbor out for dinner, and her comment was that ""we could have died back here and they wouldn't notice."" We waited at least 5 minutes before anyone came over to give us menus or take a drink order. We alerted them that it was our first time in the establishment and asked for recommendations, which were given but wtih minimal enthusiasm. We tried giving ""the eye"" or ""the nod"" and stopped short only of getting up to refill our own drinks during the meal. 

On the plus side, the food was very good and I have been craving it since my initial visit! I had a combination plate that let me taste a yummy chili relleno, taco and enchilada -- all were fantastic. My neighbor got the special (seafood enchiladas) and raved about hers as well.

Very conflicted feelings.

I have gone here a few times when they were located on 32nd and Greenway. Every experience was a little different.

The good-
-Sometimes the service was good. Maybe it depends on their mood. When it was good it was usually the wife who was our server. She kind of reminded me of one my aunts. Warm, slightly teasing, calling us ""bambinos"". 
- I have always liked the food. I have had the chili relleno and enchiladas entrees. Both were a solid 7 out of 10. The beans are very tasty too.

The bad-
- When the service was bad it was usually the husband. Not friendly. Slow. Wouldn't refill our waters and soft drinks. Yet seemed attentive and talkative to other tables. Made us feel like total crap.
- Slightly overpriced.
- Charged for extra chips and salsa.
- My husband didn't like the food.
- Probably my worst experience was when I called at lunchtime to place a to go order. She said they couldn't take the order because they had a huge table of people. Just flat out refused. Guess what I wanted? Just a bean burrito! It takes 30 seconds to make.

They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal.

I invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers.

So we get to Local 4...  and it's a huge let down.

The food was mediocre to bad.  

I had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact.

Steak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad.

Other friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right.

But the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to ""try""), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You're touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  

We were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I'm ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)

In any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service.

Judging by recent reviews, they're certainly not watching review sites for what people are saying, and that's too bad.","DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg",2,"2010-10-07",1,"review",1

Obviously the studio is hot -- that is an integral part of the practice, so if you are going to complain about the heat you need to go to a non-hot class at another studio.  The ""fire"" and ""water"" classes are not as hot as the traditional classes, so if you are a beginner you may want to start there.  The heat is part of the challenge and can be tough even for those who have been doing Bikram for years, so give yourself some slack until you get used to it.  (Your body WILL get used to it!)

The instructors are great -- extremely friendly and willing to spend time with you to get your technique right.  A few are too chatty in class for me -- I appreciate reminders and pointers (""chin up"", ""curl tailbone forward"", etc.) but I think some of the instructors get talking and forget how long we have been holding the postures.  I don't like moving too quickly, but I do get impatient when I know that the chattiness is going to lead to the class going over the time period.  Most of the instructors are sensitive about the length of the class but some are not -- it is not unusual to be 10-15 minutes over.  This drives me a little crazy since I am always on a tight schedule. I wouldn't say that the instructors are motivating... but they do notice when you are giving 100%.   Many of the instructors make an effort to get to know you by name and are always happy to see you.

The studio is clean.  The hot yoga room is large and mirrored with carpet.  The carpet is kind of gross but as long as you are on your mat it doesn't matter.  There is no music during class, and no talking in the yoga room.  This is different from many of the other studios around town.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and introspective.  The yogis that attend class are serious about Bikram and are generally very nice.  There is one large lady who is always naked in the shower/changing room -- and will stand there completely naked forever and talk to whomever is in the room.  The shower/changing room is pretty crowded so it is very awkward.  I am glad that she is comfortable with her naked body but I am not.  #gross

Anyway, the yogis are generally not pretentious and not the ""Myers Park stay at home mom"" crowd that you'll find at other studios.  These are lifelong serious yogis and I love that about this place.  The students are very diverse - men, women, all ages, all races, all body types.  And, all are at different levels of their practice.  It's refreshing.

Another major plus about Yoga Oasis is the price -- $75 for 10 classes ($60 if you are a first-time student).  This is cheaper than many of the ""good karma"" deals at other studios!  It is seriously worth every penny and then some.

All in all, this is a great studio and I will keep coming back.  I am only giving 4 stars because of the limited class schedule and the frequency that the class goes over the sixty or ninety minute period.  Oh, and the carpet.  Other that those things, this place is perfect!","3EuEKK7jlcVwhU_4D7Kmkw",4,"2013-12-02",3,"review",1

The best shape (physically and spiritually) that I have ever been in was when I practiced Bikram yoga very regularly in CA; and I would LOVE to do it again.  This is evidently the only place in Charlotte that actually does something like a Bikram sequence (most of the classes I attended at Yoga Oasis were a 60 minute variance with some poses I did not like called water sequence).  The instructors were average (no personal attention or verbal tips on the poses); but very nice.  Since there is no other non-vinyasa practices here (like Bikram) that are not based around shoulder based Vinyasa flows (i.e., down-dog and handstands), I would have probably stuck with this studio but I just can NOT get away from the mildew/fungal smell that pervades the practice space.  I REALLY tried to get past it; but it is just too distracting and disturbing - did not leave me feeling healthier.
If the owners or managers ever choose to replace the carpet with a more normal yoga floor I will be back.  And if anyone is aware of another instructor or studio who does a true bikram hot yoga sequence (the same 26 poses over 90 minutes) in the area please let me know!","3EuEKK7jlcVwhU_4D7Kmkw",2,"2015-05-30",0,"review",0

Everyone here is SUPER friendly and laid back and relaxed.  I like how the instructors know that everyone is at different levels and the instruction in the classes are super detailed (no matter how many different levels of experienced people are in attendance).

Now, I'm not bikram expert... but I've definitely enjoyed the experiences here and also the challenge of the heated room.  I tend to get to class early so I can stake a spot (not underneath a heater) so I don't get too woozy during class, but the heat does really help with stretching and loosening of muscles.  Last class I grossed myself out a bit since there was a pool of my own sweat on my mat (I need to get a bigger towel).

I've also attended a non-bikram class here and it was good.  Though I am not a fan of the ""downward dog"" pose.... it's good to know this studio offers more than bikram because I can understand why bikram is not for everyone.

I can't speak for the ladies changing area, but the guys area has 2 showers and cubbies to place your stuff in.  The studio is kept super clean, though a little tight in some areas - it's a good size.","3EuEKK7jlcVwhU_4D7Kmkw",4,"2011-06-14",2,"review",0

I live in another part of town now, and I took a very long break from yoga in general. I was annoyed by the offerings in Charlotte and found that yoga wasn't the best thing for my body during that time. I recently decided to try yoga again. After a poor experience last weekend at another studio, I decided to return to Old Faithful.

I am so glad I went back. I did the Yin Yoga class with Elaine, whom I remember from back in the day. It was wonderful and relaxing--yet challenging--so I was definitely not bored. I knew it was time to limber up because I had been experiencing lower back tightness and foot pain. This deep, long stretch class was just the thing I needed.

I was originally a hardcore hot yogi, but I've been branching out and coming to appreciate other types of yoga, particularly yin. I really wanted to love this place because they offered so many yin classes.

 When I first joined, the teacher checked me in, overcharged me and had no idea how to work the computer.  She also didn't tell me anything about where the studio was or any logistics.  Not a big deal, but front table staff/volunteers may be something to consider.

You know when you go to yoga class with a good teacher-he/she gets you in the right headspace, explains the poses well, and helps set the tone....this was not that.  I could have done it at home and probably gotten more out of it.  I mean she got you in the pose, but didn't tell you how to modify or how/when to use props.  there were a few positions where several people were obviously struggling and still there was no ideas or tips for modifying the poses.  As far as the meditative aspects, she didn't contribute a whole lot besides ""focus on the breath"".  I'm sorry, but I like a yin yoga class with props, modifications, and readings from the Bhagavad Gita/sutras/poetry, exploring a theme, nice yogaisms being said, etc.  Like why even have a teacher in the room if they don't contribute anything beyond ""sit with your legs in front of you and fold over"".  There wasn't even any talk about finding your edge!

You may try their yin class and like it....until you go try yin somewhere else and see what you're missing out on.  The room was a great space as far as lighting and openness.  Think they have carpet though which makes me cringe thinking about the microbes and sweat in those fibers.","3EuEKK7jlcVwhU_4D7Kmkw",3,"2015-04-24",0,"review",0

from what i understand, in order to teach bikram that's all you can teach...   in order to provide many different classes such as vinyasa, detox flow, yin, and various seasonal yoga classes...  this studio could not specifically call themselves a charlotte bikram studio... i may be wrong though... 

those instructors including the owner that teach the bikram style are in fact bikram certified... a bikram certified teacher teaches bikram and cannot say they teach bikram unless they are certified... so says bikram...   

this review is for those that want to explore bikram with the ability to expand their practice into a more fluid and graceful practice...  bikram was my thing when i started off in 2005... as i dedicated more time to my practice i turned more toward vinyasa and a more fluid approach... the yoga oasis provided for this foundation... 

the other classes mentioned above and the instructors that teach these classes are top notch... there is no pressure for perfect poses... yoga practice rather than yoga perfect is the 'mat' standard... there are always options provided for each asana and flow sequence depending on where you are in your practice... instructors will break down sequences... are always available after class for questions, comments, and feedback... always open for suggestions...

The instructors are kind for the most part (aside from getting berated for drinking too much water in the ""front row""), but are not very motivational.

"291",0,"HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg","ug5w2Ui7dqZhuv-UlzTKwQ","Pallucci is a quaint Italian restaurant located in the Mount Pleasant/Davisville area.  If you weren't a local, you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.

The menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however, that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.

The house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region, and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me, but I like hybrids!

The starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters, it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.

We opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.

For mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare, but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.

My dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.

To finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich, with a raspberry centre.

Verdict:

The staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm, and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.

The food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh.  With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development.","111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ",3,"2012-03-28",0,"review",0

Waltzed into Hazelrock on Opening Weekend and I think I ruined someone's video/picture.  Oops?  I came here because my dearest friend told me to so I did!  I had snooped on their website and blog the week before so I knew I *had* to try the Ferrero cookie on top of some other goods.  Between the two of us, we had a cookie, a lemon bar that was recommended by the friendly barista with the cool hair, a macchiato, and an iced tea.  

The first sip of the espresso sent me straight onto Cloud 9.  It was rich, fragrant, and creamy.  It made Addiction stir and I was hooked by that vixen.  Girl, I will never give you up again.  The iced tea helped clean the palate as well as that super tasty and tart lemon bar.  Could this be fresh lemon juice?  If it was concentrate, it fooled me.  As for the Ferrero cookie, it was everything I imagined it would be and more.  It was crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle.  Nutella and a very generous amount of hazelnuts decorated the top.  It got a tad too sweet with the ample amount of hazelnut spread but I imagine it being perfect with a foamy latte.  I wish they drew a tiny leaf in my espresso...

The coffee shop itself is very hipster industrial chic --- wood, steal, a bike, a marquee arrow, a mattress sans the cover and fluff, and glass bottles as lighting. It was very cool.  I like the concrete floors and all the reclaimed wood.  I could imagine a young Joyce sitting here with all her other art student friends, the WP Carey business majors working on their stuffy group assignments on the leather couch and arm chairs, and the regular Tempe resident grabbing a cuppa before work.  It's a large space with lots of chairs, stools, and tables for all. 

And if the drinks and pastries aren't enough to lure you in... they also sell snow.  SNOW!

My girlfriend and I arrived in the mid afternoon on a fairly slow day. The space was nice and open - this place would do well for those looking to study. I couldn't help but notice however the modern chicness of it all, which did come across as semi-contrived. But whatever, it still gave good energy. 

The menu looked interesting and expansive. There were a few choices on there I haven't seen before, such as a coconut cold brew, or a hazelnut milk latte. After some questions about the various drinks, bean sources, etc, I opted to go for the hazelnut milk latte with white chocolate added. My girl had a Brazilian hot pour coffee coffee with hazlenut milk on the side. Tempted by the tasty looking pastries, we also decided to get a peach pie. It was a pie and coffee kind of day.

We noticed immediately that there was something off about the hazelnut milk. I was expecting something silky and slightly creamy, like good almondmilk can be. What we got tasted like wet chalk. Nasty. I had them remake my girl's coffee, and I stuck with mine. I wasn't content at all, but didn't want the hassle of them remaking two drinks. So hers came back, this time with steamed milk; but still, the coffee just wasn't good. I'm sorry - it wasn't. She and I both agreed that it tasted little better than Folger's. There was no depth, no fruit or chocolate notes, nothing. And this coming from a pour over! I can't imagine what a drip brew would taste like. 

My latte, aside from the persistent chalk texture, also had no flavor. The white chocolate was non-existent. The espresso, barely distinguishable at all. It really didn't even taste like there was any in there. I've tried nearly every coffee place's latte in the Tempe and Scottsdale area, so I have a fair idea of what is good and what is not. Again, very disappointing, especially since the menu looked so promising. And the kicker to all this is the peach pie had no flavor, no life, nothing. It tasted like a frozen pie that had been defrosted and was sitting out for hours. This supposedly being a made from scratch pastry! Oh, and the barista forgot to even bring it to us, immediately after we ordered it. We had to remind her. 

The people were fairly nice, and the space was inviting, which saves this place from being a one star in my book. But I know we will certainly not be back. That's a shame, because with the location, layout, and interesting drink selections, this place has potential. Right now though, it just seems all for show. A good artifice with no substance.","0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA",2,"2015-09-16",1,"review",1

I tried the coconut flavored cold brew the first time I went and it was...weird. The flavors don't meld in a pleasing way. Their normal cold brew has a great flavor, it's not too acidic. I like the location, and it is a great place for studying, with lots of tables and outlets. I had been there a few times before and always had great service (one of the baristas, Emily, always gives good recommendations) but on my last visit, one of the male baristas was very rude and condescending. I probably won't be back, because I am uninterested in feeling judged for what I order.

They make their perfectly-piped pastries and almond macadamia nut milk in-house... That's just how I had to start this review.

But seriously, this place is a winner. The set-up is unlike any other coffee shop. It's open but you find yourself in your own world once you sit down. During our first visit, my boyfriend and I ordered a chai and banana bread. The chai was a 4/5 but the banana bread was so good, we went to order another one. The girl at the counter gave us another banana bread for half off and threw in a coffee cake for FREE... just because!

I've gotten a few lattes and drip coffees since, and they've all been pretty tasty! This is the spot for you if you're in your twenties, looking for a comforting baked good, need your coffee in a rush, or need a place to work/study. We probably come here twice a week now.

"322",22,"M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA","Q71GCnterKVFlARdlVvcMQ","First visit was just OK.  Felt like I was sitting in a garage building.  The coffee and pastry bar sits in a corner far from the entrance doors.  Owners/management: please put up better menu signs to allow first-timers and those who do not know what's available to choose, instead of feeling pressured to order something fast at the cash register- the menu was on plaques placed right in front of the register.  There were a few pastries on display, but the ones that caught my attention were on one of the guest tables.  Looked like bruschetta, but with nutella and chunky nuts.  Apparently, these were being tested for an upcoming breakfast offering.

I liked the cold brew tasting-- four cold brews of your choosing, for $6.  You then get to choose a 12 oz. pour of cold brew, or opt for any pastry/dessert from the case.  I chose Ethiopian, Apple Jack, Blackberry-Lavender, and Coconut.  Funny how the two I thought I'd enjoy the most (the last two) would be my least favorites!  I'd definitely order the Ethiopian cold brew again, and perhaps the Apple Jack with cream.  The blackberry-lavender was too tart, and I could only detect the berry, which was unfortunate, since I love lavender-scented anything: chocolates/truffles, ice creams/gelatos, shortbreads, soaps, and lotions, etc.  The house-made tiramisu was just OK.  Actually, I didn't eat much of it at the time, since I already had enough milk fat and sugar from the salted creme brûlée coffee here, and I ended up throwing away the leftovers at home that night, since most of the takeaway cup was filled with waxy cream filling.  The female rep here told the new guy that he must stress that everything here is made in-house, from the cold brews steeped with herbs, spices, and fruits the night before, to the hazelnut-chocolate spread and the caramel syrup and melted chocolate used in coffees.  

I wished I'd gone with the huge chocolate chip cookie with the house-made hazelnut-chocolate spread, instead of the tiramisu...  I may come back for a second visit, but not before I check out all the other coffee shops I've bookmarked for years.

This time I got the berry iced coffee. It was $4 for large iced coffee. Again, not worth it. I'm not sure what it is supposed to taste like, but it tasted burnt and very acidic to me. Not good. Because I really wanted to like this place, I went one last time. Again, small iced soy latte. Tasted like watered down milk. It had no smooth coffee or even soy milk taste! Just like water.

The snow-style shaved ice was really yummy too! The mango flavor was very tasty. I had it topped with fresh fruit, and it was a great combination.

After checking out the pastries on display I went with the chocolate vanilla bean cupcake and a salted brulee latte.

This shop is large, very large, and has a giant case of pastries. I have been twice, the lattes have been delicious both times (or maybe once I got a cortado?) and the pastries have ranged from omg amazing to very good. The first time we came, I got the espresso brownie.... took it home, ate it 1-2 days later.... I thought I had died it was so delicious. Just rich chocolate with walnuts and pecans.... trust me, it was great. The next time, I had the nutella pie, which was good, but heavy on the whipped cream and brought another brownie home. Ate it the next day.... not as good as the first go around, but good. I'll definitely be back.","0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA",4,"2015-07-12",3,"review",2

As I sit here, it occurs to me that I've only had the cold/iced drinks. They were good, but I'd imagine I'll enjoy the hot drinks even more, as they're made to SCAA (and soon to be SCEA) specifications. 

Their Ferraro cookies are fantastic, and the tiramisu provided a good counterpoint to the coffee.

So I only received 3 for the price of four. They offered me a free pastry, which was nice, but since I had already eaten one, that was hard to stomach, wasn't at all what I wanted.

My boyfriend ordered the white chocolate mocha, which was served with spoiled milk. When I let the Batista know, she indicated that I didn't know what sour milk, tastes or smells like, and suggested that it was the real white chocolate that they use. (There isn't such a thing as real white chocolate) and surely it shouldn't taste like spoiled milk.

The coffee there is fine, but it's always kind of a weird, tense shitshow in there. I was glad to see that the baristas in Hazelrock were not fronting the  typical coffee-chain overhyped, aggressively sunny demeanor and just spoke like real humans. Thank you.

The interior is spacious, open, and extremely clean and polished. Great care was taken to design the menu boards and they're packed with information about their proprietary beans: tasting notes, production information, growing regions (today it was Brazil, Ethiopia and Cameroon). I personally was thrilled to see this, and excited about the prospect of choosing a bean (I went with the Ethiopian).

After ordering, I waited a few minutes and was given an iced coffee when I had wanted hot. The barista was apologetic and mentioned that she ""just assumed"" and I admitted that I didn't specify, either. However, I do think that if you don't specify, it should be hot. Isn't that the default? At any rate, I just ended up going with the iced coffee since I was in a hurry (and anyone who knows iced coffee knows that Ethiopian beans are the best for iced anyway.) No big deal. The coffee itself was great, by the way. Bright, vibrant notes, smooth and intense. Yes. 

When it comes down to it, all the high-concept, coffee-as-the-new-wine, making-the-gourmet-the-norm is essential, and there is a market for it, and it's necessary to raise the bar and lift us from the depths of the bottom of Einstein's brown-stained coffee urn, but you also have to be able to take orders, and make drinks fast and not have your baristas short circuit and blow up when someone orders ""just a decaf, please"". I think the real mark of excellence in coffee comes from a certain subtlety: exceptional coffee that doesn't need to be dressed up and called out by a long list of pseudo-Italian terms. Good coffee can be served black, as-is, and stand on its own. And no matter how you market it, if it's a good roast, people will notice.","0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA",4,"2015-08-21",1,"review",1

I'm convinced Ina was thinking of the Ferrero Rocher cookie when she said this because this cookie....it is the real deal. Perfectly chocolatey, crunch and indulgent, this signature treat of Hazelrock's can easily be shared, but you probably won't want to.

The pastry case is a first come first serve situation, so once they are out of something, typically they are out of it for the day. Except for the Ferrero Rocher cookie. I've never not seen it in the case and I think its popularity demands that it's in the case at all times. I've also had the coffee cake which was an excellent, not too crumbly, not overly sweet pairing with our beverages. I really liked the Royal Tea latte that I had recently and it made a nice after dinner beverage. 

Hazelrock is a big, beautiful open space with lots of tables and workspaces making it perfect for studying or meeting a larger group of friends.  I prefer the couches to the other seating because the chairs are for narrow college freshman whose metabolism has not succumbed to dining hall food and Boone's Farm.

On my second visit, I came with a friend. I ordered a latte (they don't do flavoured lattes and it's weird that the employee didn't suggest the salted brúlée latte that several people seem to be raving about in the reviews). The latte was OK. I think if you're a coffee person you might appreciate it more. My friend got a hot chocolate with cow's milk and he thought it was watery even thou it was made with whole milk. We also tried some of the sweets: the chocolate banana tart and the ferrero rocher cookie. I don't recommend eating any of these by yourself. Make sure you share it because they are hella sweet. Not a bad thing necessarily if that's what you like. The banana chocolate tart was delicious. It has real pieces of banana in there. No laffy taffy, artificial banana flavour. I enjoyed it. The cookie is a chocolate chip cookie with nutella and hazelnuts on top. Obviously it's delicious. On my third visit, I got an iced tea. I believe it was a berry black tea. I added a couple teaspoons of sugar to it and it was good. 

I haven't been wowed by any drink from this place so I give them 1 star for that. 
The two sweets that I've tried were both very good so I give them + 2 stars. That brings them to a 3 out of 5. I'm not keen to give another star for service because the employees always seem clueless about what they have. Anytime there is a girl at the register she has to ask the guy who makes the drinks what milk they have or what is in a particular drink. You should know what's in your product. Owner needs to train consistently.

Got a latte and a cold brew the times I visited and got the Ferrero Rocher cookie per Yelp's recommendations and thoroughly enjoyed it. The latte definitely gives you that kick of caffeine and the staff is always willing to answer any questions you may have. They do have a cool variety of cold brews where do steep certain ingredients i.e. cinnamon or coconut to infuse flavors and did their best to answer their methods and so on. The Ferrero Rocher cookie is for those with a killer sweet tooth! It's a soft, chewy chocolate chip cookie topped with Nutella and chopped hazelnuts ... what? I know! It's amazing.

The wi-fi is fast, there's tons of seating for groups, pairs or for the lone person. Interior is well lit, good amount of outlets and natural lighting from the windows and artificial ones over head.

PROS: Just about everything. Plenty of space, plenty of seating, plenty of *comfortable* seating, always bright and clean, a growing calendar of events (including, as I found out by accident the other night, magic shows!), a polite staff, a decent menu. Hazelrock quickly became an almost-daily go-to for me. I absolutely love the atmosphere. REALLY great place for hanging out, playing board games, studying - whatever. Good place for groups, good place for individuals. You really can't go wrong with this one.

CONS: Only one minor con, and I blame this on my snobbiness when it comes to coffee. I've noticed a pretty conspicuous inconsistency in product quality. Not sure what to attribute this to, but the fact is, Hazelrock has a lot to compete against in this area. If they can take just that *little* bit of extra pride in how their coffee is prepared, it would up my review from four stars to five.

CONCLUSION: All in all, a great addition to the budding coffee economy. Not the best coffee in the area (yet - they're still young!), but definitely one of the better locations and settings in the area. A very nice craft addition to an otherwise college area. If you haven't been, it's worth a go. You'll likely find yourself visiting often.

Stumbled randomly into this cafe / coffee / bakery on a Saturday afternoon. Originally wanted an iced mocha but the sweets looked soooo good. Couldn't help myself!

Let's get the drink review out of the way first. Cuz I'm more of a dessert person anyway. Iced mocha was great. Light and refreshing. The manager said that the mocha had real shredded chocolate on it- nice touch!

Now. The baked goods! Mmmmmm. Tried the Ferrero cookie, chocolate banana tart, white chocolate macadamia cookie, and mango flavored shaved ice (is that a thing here?). Come with a group- these treats are pretty big but shareable so it was awesome that I could taste multiple things. My favorite is the Ferrero cookie (AMAZING. Great chocolate and nutty flavor. Soft and decadent) but all of them were pretty great.

Space is really big. Lots of tables and seating. Decor is kinda hipster/rustic look. They need to add some art though on the walls to spruce the place up.

The manager and staff were very friendly.
Came to our table and asked us how we were doing and if we needed anything. Ultimately led to a conversation about coffee. I'm no coffee connoisseur but dude knew his coffee thing. Glad to see passionate people running local businesses.","0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA",5,"2015-05-16",7,"review",3

As I am admittedly claustrophobic I enjoyed the outdoor space majorly. The drinks were good and strong, but I dont know about the prices. I was there with a Detroit crowd (I guess all of Detroit moves to Phx) and for some reason I didnt have to pay for anything. 

Music was ok, nothing special, just the usual crowd pleasers and some people, mostly MILFS and GILFS (think about it) tried to dance. Gosh, please, white people, dont dance. I know, I am white, but there is a reason I date Latinas only! Mmm, what about if I am a woman and go there - how would I rate the guyz? - besides one really normal and nice guy who hit on one of my female friends - I would probably puke on the dance floor.

The service was above average. We had a great time and enjoyed being here. We left a little after the evening crowd started getting in.

It was a beautiful evening, so we sat outside on the patio.  We went back and forth on using the heat lamps provided.  Chelsea was our server and she was sweet as can be but perhaps a tad bit on the ditzy side.  The guys seemed to admire looking at her (bustier) every time she leaned over the table, and I was nervous something was going to pop out.

Aside from that entertainment, the food was decent.  It was not amazing.  I had the chopped salad which was pretty good and big enough to share, followed by the sea bass (no surprise there) entree.  Jared had an 8 oz filet and Zack had a ribeye.  We all shared spinach and sweet potato fries as sides, and the guys each had dessert.  I didn't have any (ahem - wedding diet), but they seemed to be orgasming over the chocolate lava cake... the cheese cake and berry dessert also went over well at the table.

With the 50% off Tuesday special, this was $30 per person with tip.  For the amount of food we got, this was a deal, but had we payed full price? Not so much...

I've long heard this place was THE place to see and be seen in Scottsdale. I knew that wasn't true and had no plans ever to go there. But a birthday party for a fine young man fueled my trip on a Saturday night.

Thankfully, we arrived shortly before 10 p.m. --- ahead of many of the plastic millionaires and their shiny chariots. Being the lame, tongue and knuckle dragging fools we are, of course, men had to shell out $10 while women were spared. Once inside, we could see where it was all heading.

It's an older crowd at Barcelona than, say, whatever club on Mill Avenue in Tempe. But that's not to say they are grown-ups. In fact, it is a lot more like high school than anything else. The uncool cool people prance around while spiced up oldies make communicating with anything other than hand gestures and swirling hips worthless. The black-suited security guards talking into their sleeves every few seconds also offer a real --- if not short-lived and ultimately comical --- feel that this place is actually hip. 

In a word: Underwhelming.

Make no mistake about it, though, Barcelona is beautifully appointed. Leather chairs and sofas make for comfy private lounges for the lucky (or wealthy) few who occupy them. The sprawling patio is an excellent place on a late summer evening in Arizona. Multiple bars make for relatively speedy service. And the overall gargantuan size of the place makes the crowd seem less, well, crowded.

But alas, this is no place for me. By the looks of the joint, it's no place for diners either. Middle-aged partiers with bulging eyeballs and well- yet artificially endowed gold diggers, on the other hand, are apparently welcomed with open arms.

I write reviews that demonstrate I passed high school English. She writes/compliments me... I'm cocky/funny. I offer to explore downtown with her. She turns me down. I try the next girl. Same result. But the intent is always there. After this review, I doubt I'll have to worry about succeeding with any woman who ever reads this review ever again. 

So check it out. I'm a male slut. If I meet you in person and I lay my lines on you and smile in this certain way that I've discovered makes women look away and blush, you'll definitely give me your number and probably go home with me within one more encounter. That's my M.O. It works. If it ain't broke... 

I'm not altogether proud of the man I've become but I'm not going to stop either. From what I've gathered from movies and television, my life is fairly wonderful. Unless me writing about it causes some cosmic/karmic shift and I get disfigured in a car accident tomorrow and lose my mojo, I have several strong years of carousing left in me.  

Ok, all that said, I've been reading on Yelp about all the ""cougars"" who frequent this lovely establishment. I define a ""cougar"" not by age, but as a woman who knows what she wants (me). So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole. We've been there twice in the last two weeks. Guess how many woman we've taken home or who have taken us to their homes in the last two weeks? Four. Guess how many we've given The Business to... The same four. Guess what our batting average is... .1000

Usually, I need to take a woman out one more time before The Business is exchanged. Sometimes more if she's particularly prudish. Barcelona is where The Business is the understood currency. I like The Business. So if you're reading this and you think I'm scum, I used to be you. I've ""evolved."" If you're reading this and you're a woman who knows what she wants, shoot me a message. And if you're reading this you think I'm lying because you didn't get laid last time you went there, I am willing to show you how.

I have often wondered if every bar has too many men, there must be one place where all of the women go. Where is that place? That question was once rhetorical. It turns out, in Scottsdale, Arizona, that place is Barcelona's. 

We were seated early in the section that is cleared out to make way for a dance floor as later in the night Zooey Boey takes the stage. We started with a few appetizers, of which my clear favorite was the macadamia nut encrusted shrimp; they were incredibly good (I do not even like macadamia nuts). The portions were more than generous for each person at the table. I had the bone-in-ribeye which came with a Bearnaise sauce on the side that was very good. They serve a molten chocolate desert that was heavenly on a soft bed of ice cream. We all left extremely full and even more satisfied with the meal.

I heard Brittany and Jess head to this place when they're in town...but you may/may not want to disclose that info.

The only drawback to the Scottsdale/Phoenix scene is the distance between one venue to the next.

Caution, for cougar lovers, there are a lot prowling around, waiting to sink their claws in young meat. I've never had the opportunity to eat there, so I can't say anything in regards to food.

I felt like I was in an episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County: Scottsdale Edition. I am just bitter because I came here for a joyous occasion of a wedding VIP party, but I was denied access at the door because I was wearing tennis shoes. Gimme a break, my shoes weren't some  salvation army shoes. They were quite expensive ""plaid original chucks"" that had character and style. They still denied me in after I complained saying I have never had a problem in LA, SF, NY, VEGAS but clearly Scottsdale I do.  

Anyways, after the $10 cover charge, they gave me a ticket for a free fish taco or something. Sick. I don't want to eat fish tacos at 11pm. This place reminded me of Cheesecake Factory after dark. Everyone is old. They don't have a DJ, instead they have a band that does bad covers of bad songs like ""Wind it Up"" and ""Glamorous"". 

Worst part? I saw old guys wearing phat farm tennis shoes and mandals. How the hell are mandals allowed at a club but trendy kicks aren't?

Avoid this place at all costs unless you want to get picked up by a lonely horny housewife of Scottsdale. The themesong to this place should be Nelly's MANEATER.","4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw",1,"2007-03-23",2,"review",2

What can't I say about this place that hasn't been said before?

Food:  they have a new chef, so apparently they heard others talking badly about the food.  I actually really enjoyed the food and our server was awesome.  Ridiculously expensive?  Yes.  Good to my tum?  Definitely.  We decided to try a little of everything so in our menu was the Seared Ahi, Chopped salad with bacon dates, Tenderloin empanadas, Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes, and sweet potato fries.

Ahi was seared perfectly.  It had a slightly spicey musky sauce with it.  Very yum unless you don't like raw-ish fish.  Bacon dates are my new favorite.  Mmmm.  Empanadas were good, but you didn't really get much of a meat flavor.  Caprese was wonderfully fresh.  Sweet potato fries....god yes.

Price per dish around $9 to $14.  You're looking at about $25 for an entree.  Drinks were relatively decent in price...but $12 for a glass of wine.  My favorite Reisling is $12 per bottle, for crying out loud.

This place is AWESOME for people watching.  Young things with massive...melons of flesh, meat-head men trying to look cool, 50+ women trying to outdo the young things, and 50+ men ogling everyone creepily.

The singers on stage were quite cheesy.  Great choice in music, but I'd much rather listen to the DJ version than a upscale karaoke.  No dude, you're NOT bringing sexy back with those aviator shades and check shirt.  And whoa...the female singer...honey, you need someone else to do your extentions.

Wierd mix of dress code:  from prom date to stained t-shirts.  Ugh.

$9 for a pack of cigs (I don't smoke, but I heard) and you can order a drink in the bathroom.  Wha?  So you can drink and pee all night long and never have to leave the room?

Funny, funny place.  I'd probably go again mainly for the abundance of people watching.  This place doesn't get more than three mainly for the cheese factor and the prices.  At least sugar daddies abound at this place.","4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw",3,"2007-08-26",2,"review",2

A lovely young woman of my recent acquaintance invited me here recently for the purpose of attending a birthday party for a friend of hers. Neither of us would have come here otherwise. 

If you're thinking about going, don't do it. If you care for the deets, read on. If not, stop reading here and.... go somewhere else. Please. 

We show up at about 8 for drinks and dinner. I wasn't in a drinking mood, my date's Appletini was pretty Appley but the amount of liquor was tini. Must be why they call it an Appletini. Hm. Highlight was the bread brought to the table - the pretzel rolls were the highlight of the evening. How sad is that?

Now... the place is called Barcelona. Barcelona is a city in Spain. THe closest thing to a Spanish dish on the menu us Paella, otherwise it's a steakhouse menu with a few obligatory pasta dishes. Totally uninspired.

I ordered the ribeye, medium rare. It came out medium, and the glaze and whatever else they put on it were awful, save the two onion rings. I doubt this was USDA prime beef. It just wasn't that good, and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what I was eating. The shoestring fries side were a pleasant surprise - a giant mound of crispy potato. 

My date had some kind of pasta with shrimp dish. The shrimp were overdone, the pasta was, ok. Denny's pasta is OK, too, and let's face it, so is Chef Boyardee... So don't read too much into the complement. 

Barcelona. Spain. The place doesn't look that Spanish on the inside. There is a giant mural on the ceiling, dim lights, it reminds me more of Las Vegas cheese than Spain. 

While you dine, there are two Scottsdouche (or is it Douchedale?) types crooning back and forth to each other on stage. Is this where failed American Idol contestants try to relive their moment of glory? I don't know. They made a reappearance later, singing along with a DJ to a selection of bad 90's pop music with the occasional 80's party jam. 

The crowd is douchey. The food is awful and on the pricey side. The service, spotty.

2.  BBQ - If you're sitting outside on the patio, prepare to smell like BBQ chicken after you are done.  I don't know who designed this, but it was pretty poor engineering.  You don't build a BBQ in the middle of the lounge, so that your patrons get smoke in their faces.

3.  Fancy Cars - Sure I love Ferrari's just as much as the next guy, but the fact that they put them in the front is sort of lame....like they're trying too hard to make themselves look uber-cool.

It actually is a restaurant, too. The food is Ok. The Paella is huge and not bad. They try real hard to make this place the chi-chi joint for the hip resort/snowbird crowd. It is huge, with several dining areas and bars, a large patio, and a small stage and decent dance floor. They usually have live music on the weekends and intersperse with Disco DJs. On weekends you have cowgirls walking around with their ""shooters"" holsters and shot glasses thru the 4 bars. A lot of the waitresses (not just here, but in most of Snotsdale's higher end joints) are part time ASU coeds trying to make a buck to buy more short skirts and halter tops at the mall. 

Everyone at night is pretty much trying to create an impression beyond their true reality, whether it is the young diggers or the old farts. If you are from Dallas or Calgary, you will probably like this place for its unapologetic panash for conspicouus consumption.

I had gotten a $20 day pass,  and had a pretty good time by the pool with my friend.    At a time, there had been some porn stars frolicking in the water, they were making hamburgers (the staff, not the porn stars),  and the place had a sort of 80's, West Hollywood-camp charm.

Recently I headed to a trade show in Vegas, and for the first time my hotel room wasn't being paid for by my job, so I decided to try out the Blue Moon.

PROS:  

For me, I like that it's off the strip. (Less traffic, not as many obnoxious tourists, etc.)  Also the biggest selling point for me is your proximity to your car.   (you are definitely going to want to rent a car if you stay here, in my opinion)  I absolutely hate the self parking rigamaroo  and subsequent trek through throngs of casino-goers and  miles a dreary, carpeted passageways just to get to your room that is the norm at most of the big hotels.   here you just open your car door and step inside.   it's an old TravelLodge,  so you get the idea of the setup.

Since it is a gay-owned and operated business, there are a few feel-good points awarded for staying here, and supporting the community.   stuff is generally very nice and the owner is attentive, and seems to get what people want.

There is a nice breakfast spread in the morning including  2-hour coffee, which is a bonus.

There is a steam room and  kind of seedy  porn watching area,  if you're into that.

CONS:   

Don't go there expecting to meet a porn star.   I'm sure it happens, but this isn't the cast's quarters for Chippendale's, lol.  

If you want to have guests at the hotel, you sort of have to go  down and let them in at night.   not a big deal, and it makes sense from a security standpoint, but is not as freewheeling as some other places.

If you are used to staying at the Bellagio,  and need to park next to a Bentley  to get yourself through the day,  skip this place.   as I said, it is campy and fun,  not glamorous or chic.   but at the end of the day, ask yourself... what is Vegas really all about?","8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ",4,"2010-01-14",8,"review",4

"434",3,"QQoZeJszS2mWhMRcs5og4Q","GjcERxzREIVo7YIDkTqgHA","If you are looking for an all men's gay hotel in Vegas, this is your one option and it falls into that tough category of:  because it's gay, we'll stay there to be with our people.  So, we did.  Our first time.  Thankfully, we paid the Sunday night rate and we got that value.  The place as a whole is a little rough around the edges.  Other guests we talked to love the place and return.  We probably wouldn't.  It's the little things: no luggage rack for suitcase, no towel bars for bath towels (install a couple of hooks?), exposed wires on the walls (and extra bunched on the floor) for accent lighting, a foaming soap dispenser at sink and shower (really?  like a truck stop? I'm all for conserving on little bottles and soap bars - install a three-way liquid soap dispenser and that way you can also offer your guests shampoo and conditioner - which they don't now.  $16).  The back stairs that lead to the pool over look areas of junk.  Trash by the pool equipment etc.  So easy to just throw that stuff away.  It's in plain sight of guests and just adds to the attitude of general lack of care.  So, picky?  Well, maybe.  But, these very simple little things are what sets apart hotels and makes for a guest wanting to return.

Now, the good stuff:  the Sunday pool party was very busy and fun.  Maybe 40 men (mostly au natural) sunning and frolicking.  Guests seemed to have a great time (bring your own cooler).  Breakfast was really excellent (a big pleasant surprise!).  Bed very comfortable and linens all nicely clean.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Free WiFi worked well in the rooms.  Large steam room was nice.  Video room was popular.  And, with the day pass system, you get to mingle with some local boys, too.

So, for the gay boys who like to roll with the boys, have a great time!  We'll pass next time.  But, then, we live in Palm Springs and get plenty of gay all the time.  For others not in that position, they'll have a different perspective.","8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ",3,"2013-07-16",8,"review",2

It is not right on the strip but holy cow you can drive up a side street - take a left and drive right into the Wynn and park.

For those of you used to lots of luxury - this is not your place to go.  I am a bit spoiled - but I appreciated the slow pace and the men's only atmosphere. 

I enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and the slow pace.  

There are only a few things I would ask that they do.

1) have each room set up with a book that details the locations and areas of the different things for the hotel.

2) there needs to be an monthly updated calander in the each room

3) there needs to be a better list of gay clubs and venues as well as the times and locations,.

4)Towels need to be replaced and all the lights in the rooms need to work.

5) The coffee in the rooms needs to be free.  2 bucks for in room coffee is a pain in the butt.  Raise the room rates a smidge to help cover it. 

This in an older hotel and I understand that - for those of you who can,..get a suite on the pool side of the hotel.  It cuts down on noise.  You can also peek at your car in the lot.

Staff is great - be prepared for the fact that most of us who can afford to vacation have worked our lives and are not so excellent looking,..LOL!

All in all - I would encourage you to try it - get the parlor suite - pool side view and dont go in with attitude. The convience to get to the strip is awesome if u have your own car.","8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ",4,"2011-01-19",6,"review",0

Pros:  staff is awesome, including John the owner.  It is clothing optional, so if you want to lay out by the pool sans Speedo, you can. The pool area and hot tub is nice. Fun when there is a group staying there or sunday bbq pool parties. Continental breakfast is free and pretty decent.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  It's quiet.  If you want to cruise, that option is available to you. Free parking close to your room. Very happy to let me do a late check out and then hang around the pool the rest of the day until my late afternoon flight.

Cons:  they are 5 minutes off the strip.  Absolutely no biggy though--it's a quick car ride or cab ride to the strip.  There is nothing within walking distance for food or anything to do (sketchy industrial-ish neighborhood), but again- a quick hop to the strip.
The price is high relative to what you can get for a nicer strip hotel--but, if you want to stay at a clothing optional resort with other gay folks, that's what you are paying for.  The room I had wasn't fabulous---the TV was like 14"".  C'mon guys, you can get a 42"" for $250. A lot of it is in the details though--there was a light out in the bathroom.  The shower head sprayed water all over the place.  The elevator light is one exposed light.  There is ""junk"" off the pool area that you can see if you go out the end exits.  Kind of looks like the money was put in up front in the rooms and then nothing much has been updated since then.  It was a bit of a ghost town, even with Hustlaball in town (I had hoped there would be an afterparty like there was 5 years ago (which i missed!)).

Would I go back?  Depends on the event and the price.  I've also stayed at a strip hotel and done a day pass for $25.","8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ",3,"2014-01-24",0,"review",0

I've also stayed here a couple of times before my last stay.  The other reviews are right on the money about the owner and the staff.  John Hessling clearly understands customer service. It is the reason why I booked a stay there a few days while the moving truck where I was relocating from was en route to Vegas.

There is also an unnecessary snarky side to the operation and seems to prevail staff-wide. Asking for extra towels or to let a guest's visitor into the property within a reasonable amount of time (was my brother-in-law, not a trick), is not an extraordinary request.  I can understand why one would feel bothered if the room was comped.  But it wasn't. I think the owner and staff have lost sight of the fact that guests are choosing to stay there rather than the Wynn (where it was cheaper for the time of my stay at Blue Moon).  When inquiring about certain clubs, I was told by the staff at the front desk they weren't allowed to promote some of them and were directed to send me to certain venues. Not illegal, nor a surprise. But pretty crappy way to deny a guest an experience.

Mr. Hessling also has a blog where he pens somewhat bitchy copy under the name PERSON OF INTEREST and runs a hook-up app called Bent, which, though I indulge in both, is probably hurting his attention to the details at the Blue Moon.   Sadly, it is unlikely I will come back here, nor recommend it, until it gets back into the the tip-top shape it once was--and can be again.

As for the neighborhood, this is all subjective. No one has ever been mugged, murdered, accosted (unwillingly, at least) in the area.  Hessling does put a premium on security, and for that, I have to give him credit.","8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ",2,"2014-02-28",0,"review",0

"440",12,"wQ0sfn7h5n99Hhpbyg-TYA","EMqJ3_3SxxBI2VOVaATfyA","Okay, let me state the pros up front just to be fair. 

David is the owner and he does answer the phone, and gets up to the front desk fairly quickly when you walk in.  

Be aware that the day pass is only good until 8pm, then light's out honey, on your way home if you are visiting without having a room there.  

They do have a very nice pool with a waterfall shower, and privatized (walled-in jacuzzi).  It is clothing optional, so try to be nice to those who are over-endowed :)

Also, to be fair, the whole place looked clean.  

Finally, decor and music are totally gay chic, good for him. 

To be fair, I didn't stay in the hotel part, so you'll have to check for yourself on their quality.  Hopefully that matches the price. 

Okay now the cons.  First it is really hard to find if you're not local.  Cab drivers haven't heard of it so bring the mapquest with you. 

David is kind of a jaded indifferent queen in my opinion.  Okay to be fair, yes it takes one to know one.  But he did something no retail queen should.  I asked him where the towels were and he said oh by the blue tins at the pool - of course when I get over there all the towels in the bin are - you guessed it...WET. 

Okay, could happen, he could be busy while supplies don't last, but then he got all huffy about having to get me a clean one.  

Also, David, honey really do SOMETHING to upgrade that locker ""room"".  It looks like it should star in a scene of ""OZ"" - the one about the prison .

Also, he has that cell phone plastered to his ear.  And not the incoming calls asking questions about the place either.  I really don't like it when retail queens make waiting paying customers seem like we are interrupting their hot gossip session when they are behind the counter. 

I know, he and others will say - it's  his place, he can run it the way he wants.  Well, attitude can be everything, and he needs to work on his.  We do keep him in business.  After leaving the interactions with him I only felt slightly welcome to come back, us customers can be SUCH a nuisance when he is trying to have a juicy cell phone conversation.   

It's nice that he provides internet, although it's screaming slow to load, and definitely not Comcastic.  

Finally, if you plan a massage, they are by appointment, so schedule ahead, their massage guy is really hit and miss.","8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ",3,"2008-06-10",14,"review",4

I was there in early March, so it wasn't ""in season"", but the pool, waterfall and jacuzzi were available.  I think the rooms are terrific, mine had a huge flatscreen, separate sound system, couches, chairs and a bathroom that was brightly lit (hard to find in any hotel).  I had a fridge and bar sink in the main living area, a huge walk in closet and windows that actually opened.

You do need to depend on cabs or a car, but there is free parking, steps from the entrance, not like the half mile long jaunts from the parking lots of the large strip hotels.  While the area is mostly industrial, there are several other properties within half a block.  I never felt unsafe.

John, one of the owners, was on the property almost every day and couldn't have been nicer.  

If you're looking for cruising, you'll find it.  If you're not, you'll have a pleasant stay in a unique property with a friendly stay who will go out of their way for you.  At the time I traveled, my room was half the price of most of the mid-range strip hotels, so the affordability was a huge plus.","8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ",4,"2014-03-24",1,"review",0

The decor is sketchy, to say the least.  When we got there (just after 7pm) we were the only people there.  Paper place mats, folded paper menus, not necessarily the cleanest cutlery I've ever seen.  Service was poor.  The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.

Not the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.

The food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.  I would go back and eat just that any time.

  Given a table and a chilled bottle of water I got started.. Two rows of food with an additional row containing some yogurt rice, watermelon, sauces/dressings and some meh looking fruit pudding.. Needless to say I kept focused on the main two rows.

  As I feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh, spicy 'chicken 65' - sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top, and some excellent chicken tandoori I was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat - aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl... 

  The recipes carry an authenticity to them... 4/5 stars - Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch. Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price (little high on weekends at $13+ per adult), a slighttlyyy bigger selection, and dinner buffet availability...

My kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  

I asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.

The downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal. Since they are so confused and can't be bothered to give menus or post the prices and ages, we probably won't go back often.","3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g",3,"2012-07-19",0,"review",0

Yelp hasn't led me wrong yet...but anyways, I had wanted to try Matka, was starting to see the reviews and thought oh it's time to check this place out! When I suggested it he said yea sounds good.  That right their gave him some points, cuz it's normally my girlfriends that I talk into going with me to try new ethnic cuisines.

So got their around 6:30pm, Date looked cute & fly! We walked inside and saw we were one of the 1st people there, the owner, who was present was very friendly and helpful with everything. The place is very cute on the inside; I think we were early, because we had decided on trying out the dinner buffet to try a little bit of everything, and the owner asked us to give him a few mins to get all the serving spoons out. No problem we stayed at our table and sat and talked,  then owner said its ready! Oh yea baby I was starving and ready to go!

I tried a cauliflower dish, don't know what it was called but god it was good! Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi? Man that too was packed with little bit of heat, but not in a bad way, those 2 dishes might even get me to be a vegetarian for maybe a hour or so, um maybe not because I then spotted the butter chicken in that creamy orange sauce and the chili chicken with big slices of jalapenos and though who can live on veggie alone! Both the butter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too.  Meal and Date were perfect! It was a good night!

Also side note, my date tried the goat biryani and thought it to be spicy and told the owner, who tried it and said yea it's on the spicy side, will make up a new batch right now, now to me that's excellent service!

Had the Palak Chicken which was good flavor, green sauce with spinach.  We also ordered Poori bread, which had big bubbles that were fun to poke at.

The food is a little spicy, but we like spicy!  One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us.

Also had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh.

There were many dishes which included South Indian and North India.  The paneer was just not right, too much tomato sauce and store bought paneer doesn't amount to great tasting butter paneer.  The chicken dishes were average to below average.  The dessert was horrible - runny mango custard, tasteless fried sweet bread.

There was zero ambience.  It was very 'store like'. I wish all the restaurants around could take a cue or two from 'Chutneys' in Tempe.  They have excellent tasting food, great ambience (because they actually employed an interior designer to do up their restaurant) and great prices.  Their flavors are unmatched.

The restaurant itself is very boring with no music or ambience and uninviting. I was hoping that we get some good food there. The papadum tasted horrible probably because of the oil. The Gulab Jamoons were torn apart in the buffet tray and not even a single intact piece was there. The tandoori chicken tray was empty. They did not care to refill the empty food trays. The owner was bit rude when we complained to him of the quality. The buffet itself is about 11.95 + TAX on the week end including friday. I don't mind paying 13 dollars for the food, but not for the food they offer.

First of all, the variety seemed rather limited, which is surprising for a buffet.  I'm not at all a vegetarian, but I usually look forward to Indian buffets for the vegetarian choices.  Not so here.  They do have the usual Aloo Gobi (cauliflower dish), Palak Paneer, and the pakoras.  The quality was ok, but nothing special.  As for the meat dishes, the butter chicken rather bland - shocking for butter chicken, I know.  Disappointing :(.  They also had a lamb curry (ok, but not as flavorful as most Indian lamb dishes should be), Chili chicken (actually pretty good!), Chicken vindaloo (average ) and a few other things that I can't remember since they were relatively nondescript.  The price was acceptable.  The decor was typical.  The service was pleasant enough.

Cons:
a. The chef needs to know that Indian food needs salt . Food tastes like Indian hospital food if theresn't any salt.  I heard another person complain as well when I entered.. So am not alone.
b. When this restaurant had a different owner , I thought I saw better ambiance inside.. Right now there is a mirror that is about it.. Just plain walls everywhere.. Booths did look very small and we didn't try it anyways. Interestingly , there was no music either ..
c. Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water, spices, Dal and vegetables like onion. In here only the first ingredient was present.
d. When we entered , the Naan tray was empty. When I tried twice later on, they were empty. When I left , they were empty. The owner or manager was right there. But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all. I left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan. My wife who was fortunate to get one piece said it was good.
c. Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry. Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice.
d. What is up with the vegetarian choices - egg plant curry and zucchini curry.. Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet?
e. The served bottle water which was good but food should be good too which was absent.
f. I thought the menu said vegetable biryani. I only saw colored rice. Didnt taste like Biryani.
g. Food felt fresh as the website claimed . Only the chef needs to learn to cook better.
h. I wouldnt go there for dinner . The owner needs to add some interiors to this restaurant otherwise it would compete only with the C-Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner.

I would revisit to give them a fair chance at dinner this month.. But right now it is 1.5 stars..There are better Indian choices at the moment in the valley.","3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g",2,"2012-07-29",0,"review",0

You get the idea.  We left to get some coffee and returned about a half hour later to find 3-4 more vendors.  There was a honey vendor, hummus, cookies, produce, a couple sandwich places, flowers...and the one place with produce.

(And I'm not one of the people comparing it to how it was in the 70s either - I am a 21 year old college student that thinks it is yuck.)

Mill Avenue is not the hype people give it. It is disgusting. It's dirty and grimy (and not just because it's old). There are homeless drug addicts everywhere you turn, that will harrass you if you don't give them change, and scare the crap out of me when I have to walk past. I will NOT walk down Mill after dark alone. 

Full of wasted college kids here every weekend night of course, and it is a terrible atmosphere if you're not 21-24 looking to get hammered and lucky.

Good luck finding parking, it's all metered, expensive garages, or free 3 blocks away at Farmer and 5th, but that's usually full of students' cars.

EDIT: No more free parking, ANYWHERE! 5th and Farmer is now ""Permit Only"" until 6 pm. So if you want to get lunch or hit happy hour, you are SOL on parking. Gee, Mill Avenue, guess you really must not be doing well, that you have to take more and more free parking away every few months.

The stores are all corporate garbage, except for Old Town Books, Hippie Gypsy and a couple independent (at least I think) restaurants/bars. How exactly is a giant PF Changs, Urban Outfitters, and Starbucks conducive to ""local flavor""? The rent in the area is outrageous, hence why the mom-and-pops can't stay in business.

And if I didn't hate Mill Avenue enough, the fact that they had a cute mom-and-pop ice cream sandwich store (Cookiez) and then allowed ""Slickables"", a big honking backed-by-tons-of-money store selling the EXACT SAME PRODUCT with Dreyers ice cream to move in across the street. That was just in poor taste, especially since Cookiez is now out of business.

There used to be fewer chains and the vibe was much more bohemian, making it more or less the only part of the Valley with any personality. Several years later, visitors to Mill Avenue really just go to a simulacrum; a soulless husk of an Old West-ish main drag. Don't be fooled by the ""historical buildings"" on the street, as a number of them are over a century old, but quite a few were built architecturally designed to look old. I can appreciate the aesthetic value of it, just as I can appreciate the attempt to make a walkable neighborhood. Unfortunately, only this synecdoche of Tempe is walkable: the majority of visitors have to drive to get here (not good for a bar-hopping/drinking-and-driving destination) and the lack of amenities would still make it difficult to live and work here without a car, unless they shop for groceries at the corner CVS. Its proximity to ASU is likely to keep it a popular destination, as is Downtown Phoenix' laziness and willingness to let Tempe take prominent events (i.e. Oktoberfest, New Year's Eve,) but all in all it's worth avoiding.","0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw",1,"2010-11-21",3,"review",3

I'm gonna have to be brutally honest with you, Mill Avenue is not the coolest place in Tempe.  In the old days, Mill was more of a bohemian paradise, with hippie street performers, people walking in the street and a cookie shop that opened it's doors and wafted the smell of cookies through the air.

Today, the Mill Avenue District (Isn't ""District"" a bit lofty of a word to describe a two mile strip on one street?) has been more commercialized.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing - look at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, that's commercial and fun.  But Mill is home to several bars, 3 clothing stores and a mixture of expensive and inexpensive restaurants.  If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an ""arts district"" a ""shopping district"" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the ""Mill Avenue District"" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.

Mill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.  Even if they somehow afford one, the rent and the lack of people buying things usually drives them in the ground (Swell Clothing RIP).

However, Mill is not without it's merits.  If you ARE looking for a place to get drunk, it's very convenient, especially for ASU students.  Slices is a great no nonsense pizza by the slice joint.  Occasionally, there are events like the Arts Festival, which end up being fun.

I really don't like the police force out there (are any of them good in the Valley?), they are way too in your business which they should be for disruptive or drunk people, but not really for those of us who are clearly not doing anything wrong. If I am sitting on a bench on Mill Avenue that does not imply that I am also a drunk underage drug dealer as well.
However there are many disruptive people on Mill Avenue, and it seems that the cops are less worried with those who are actually committing crimes. I mean I am a firm believer in the saying ""two each his own"", do what you gotta do to be happy. I am not easily bothered but when I walk down a street and see a man peeing in the open, a man vomiting in a bush, a group of guys in speedos, and a group of girls in lacy bras within five minutes, I am a bit irritated. Especially because more than a few cops passed by and my friends and I are the only ones who look suspicious.
There are also the countless creepers you can find on Mill Ave. I am not talking about the homeless, they are actually quite easy to get along with around there. I am referring to the guys that basically harass everyone of the female gender that walks by.
I mean I suppose I should know what I'm getting myself into by heading over to a place such as Mill Avenue, but it's a bit ridiculous.","0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw",2,"2011-09-28",5,"review",4

These days it has a different feel, shops are empty and stores are opening and closing within a few months.

"493",3,"v65s1beaC6UmT_beUJ0Jmg","blMeGTwmqNqzLUnQ7MNOLg","I visited Mill Avenue yesterday afternoon after a long period of avoiding it, mostly because of the parking situation and the aggressive panhandlers. It's been a while, I thought, and many of the corporate chains that ruined the street are fleeing as fast as their trucks can carry them off. It's worth a shot. 

I attempted to park in front of the now-vacant Z-Gallerie, only to find that meters had been installed. Of course, nobody carries change nowadays, so I followed the blue sign that read ""Public Parking"" and wound up in the virtually empty parking garage. I spent less than an hour on the street, and when I was leaving the business I'd come to visit, I asked about having my parking pass validated. ""We don't do that any more,"" I was told. ""They took our equipment. Anyway, the first hour's free."" Back at the parking garage, I was surprised when the attendant in the booth, without a word of greeting, said flatly, ""Two dollar."" ""Two dollars?"" I asked him, explaining that the first hour was free, at least according to a business owner on the street. ""Two dollar,"" he said again. I had no cash, and told him so. ""Two dollar. Two dollar,"" said the parrot in his little cage. I asked him where I could get cash on the street and he said, exasperated, ""Is two dollar!""

I backed up (unsurprisingly there was nobody behind me), parked, and, already running late for an appointment, walked to the kiosk at Bank of America, was asked for spare change by a kid lounging on the sidewalk, crossed the street, re-entered the parking garage, drove up to the booth, and again presented my parking pass to the attendant, who now said, without irony, ""Three dollar."" Evidently it cost another dollar to walk across the street to pay the already extortionate sum of two dollars. Wordlessly I handed him a twenty and, ignoring the faint smile on his lips, left Mill Avenue, this time for good. 

The last time I visited Mill (more than a year ago), I received a $40 parking ticket after having lingered too long in Borders -- another business that I see has pulled up stakes and fled for a more profitable street. At the time, though, Mill Avenue was bustling. People wanted to be there. Yesterday the street was virtually abandoned, the storefronts mostly empty, the few people I encountered seemingly killing time between classes at ASU. In short, it was devoid of life. And for this they charge to park? For this they make things as difficult as possible, both for visitors and for the businesses nobody wants to visit anymore? And why would they, when they can visit the same chain stores selling the same items in any mall in America? But as usual, it's the independent businesses who suffer -- the ones who were forced out during the first wave of Mill Avenue's corporate takeover, and the ones there now, who are fighting for their lives.

What they've done to this once-charming street is a travesty.","0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw",1,"2009-04-01",4,"review",3

Although I have to admit that I enjoy stopping by every few months for the nostalgic value.  It brings me back to my college days at ASU even though most of the places I frequented back then are gone.

Mill is a great place to go get something to eat.  Maybe even hit up a bar or two after a football or basketball game.  But if you're no longer of college age.  You may want to avoid it at all costs.","0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw",2,"2010-09-13",3,"review",2
"495",1,"5NDk-q5mv8PIDvz83HwMVg","wmyPNyhmq3MWqlLCWG6uSg","I am just going to hit on the new ""Mill Avenue's New Year's Eve"" since most of the year, Mill Ave is exactly what you would expect so you should know if this is the kind of atmosphere you want to visit or not. 

Because the Fiesta Bowl didn't find hosting the NYE block party as profitable, Tempe was left to execute the event alone starting 12/31/12. Previously, Mill was barricaded off, you had to pay to enter, and the block party included a variety of stages and outdoor vendors you could visit while mulling around the crowds or visiting the Mill Ave shops/bars. At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance. 

Now that Tempe has taken over, the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks. Now, while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture, in the case of the Fiesta Bowl, an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals, where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status, they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally. The city of Tempe's 2012/2013 event was enough to make sure I don't return next year. 

Honestly, I don't even give one star reviews but there is nothing to savor about the event as a whole. It's free and you get exactly what you pay for -- crowds of people crammed onto the sidewalks so pedestrians can't move and traffic can't make it through the crowds that saturate the crosswalks. There is no organization so each bar is doing it's own thing (except more crowded/expensive than usual), and all the while, the only ""entertainment"" is the same burnouts who always sit on Mill with their drum music trying to engage pedestrians for money.  

But should you still decide to go next year -- because the city's PR department will tell us that they've made it better than ever -- don't say I didn't warn you.","0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw",1,"2013-01-01",3,"review",2

Some teens like to light people on fire with fire crackers.  Come on peeps!  There are kids out there in the crowd.  I do not recommend bringing out your young kids to the block party even though they had a kids corner.

Mill Ave falls somewhere in between posh outdoor strip mall that tickles every fancy to unnavigable, clogged road, full of drunkards and the cops who babysit them. Either way, I'll be having a blast. Think to yourself: Where else in this town could you stumble out of the bar at 2AM, find yourself in a hookah bar until 4AM, then grab some cheap eats and chat until 6AM, when the booze starts flowing again.

Mill Avenue was once a place of tattoo parlors and biker bars. Then it got cleaned up and improved. It was then really nice. Having previously worked nearby for several years, I had not visited Mill Avenue for about a year.   I did so today. I am shocked at the changes in the past year. Did Tempe change the zoning to allow the open air loud music multi-screen scuzzy beer dives that now line the street? I can't imagine even drunk college kids thinking that these places are fun or interesting. Maybe I'm wrong, there were lots of drunks there--but not sure if they were college kids or bikers.

Just walking up and down today I counted 3 tattoo parlors and one tattoo removal place across the street. 

I guess which side of the street you are on depends on just how drunk you are.

My favourite dish is the cold spring rolls appetizer, and I often get the mango salad and Tom Yum (thai lemongrass) soup. I've found the Thai curries vary from tasty to meh, and the Pad Thai is just okay, in my opinion. On the Chinese side, I really liked  the Crispy Ginger Beef - it reminded me of Calgary Ginger Beef, which I sometimes miss! Definitely not the healthiest choice, though.

Service also varies, though it's usually pretty good. More often, I get take-out. Prices seem average given the amount and quality of the food.","DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw",3,"2012-08-05",1,"review",0

Well...one thing is that it's definitely far from paradise..hahaha...It's a pretty basic place...looks like it's from the 90's. 
For the lack of Thai restaurants in Richmond Hill I have been to this place several times...sometimes to pick up take out and sometimes for lunch. 

Some dishes like their cold spring rolls are pretty awesome and the tom yum soup is good. However I'm not really crazy about anything else in that place. Their main dishes like Pad Thai and other noodles and rice dishes are just okay... too much sauce or weird sauce flavour....I ordered stir fry veggies and it was practically raw, the sauce they used was kinda gross, so I didn't even eat the dish. 

Bottom line...I don't think I will be back...unless I get an order of take out of their cold spring rolls...They are pretty awesome , like I have mentioned! ;) 

The service is fast and good...nothing special.","DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw",3,"2012-05-25",0,"review",1

If I going to rate Phuket Paradise based on their Chicken Pad Thai, It would deserved a 1 star... 

Lunch Special from $6.99 with soup or spring roll. The selections are quite good with both Chinese and Thai fares... Maybe that is NOT a good sign? If a Thai restaurant serving chow mein..?? 

Both the Coconut Soup and Tom Yum Soup were really tasty, especially the Coconut soup which tasted good without being creamy. The Tom Yum is on the sour side, but my Yoga classmate seemed to enjoy that. 

Green Curry Chicken which suppose to be 3 chili spicy lack the spiciness, but I was surprised with all the veggie and the use of white meat in the dish. 

Pad Thai... stay away from Pad Thai.... the only thing is good about it is at least Phuket Paradise didn't use ketchup. But the Tamarind sauce they used tasted blend and the dish is kind of lukewarm not hot from the wok! 

Deco is nice but the whole restaurant smelled like bleach. But maybe I should feel assured that they scrubbed the floor really clean??!","DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw",2,"2011-07-28",1,"review",1

Paradise, it ain't, but I went to Phuket, and I liked it.

The place is very non-descript. It is clean, welcoming and bright. The menu is primarily Thai, but they also feature a large number of Chinese dishes.

I had a Thai Coconut infused seafood soup. It came quickly, was nice and hot and had a nice balance of flavour. This is at the core of Thai food, that blend of tastes with the lemon grass assertively tweaking the mix.

As an appetizer, we indulged in the cold rice paper rolls. The dip was very tasty, hut the rolls fell flat. They had an unexciting melange of vegetsbles with cellophane noodles, and not the usual shrimps. I regretted not listening to my wifenas she urged me not to order 2 serving of the appetizer.

As mains we ordered a Green Curry with heef and a Seafood and chicken Pad Thai, with a bowl of steamed rice. The Pad Thai was authentic and good, with a good amount of tamarind to arrive at the right taste and colour. The Green Curry was delicious, with an ample serving of delicious and tender slices of beef. This was a 4 star dish.

We drank Jasmine tea with our meal. Overall the food was good, the portions large and the vibe OK. At $52 before HST it was a bit pricey.This maybe due to the fact that we were charged for 2 teas.","DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw",3,"2015-01-04",1,"review",2

It's very obvious that this place is Chinese run, given that they don't realize how funny their name can be, and that they have many Chinese dishes on their menu. Even their receipts have Chinese printings. That should raise some flags in your mind about how authentic this place is. But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.

We ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out. They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding. I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.

Red Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.

Phad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots. 

Basil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.

Tamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.

Their prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise. I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp. But I wouldn't mind ordering a curry again.","DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw",2,"2015-02-20",0,"review",0

We ordered a steak, a prosciutto with melon platter, caprese salad, and a calamari. The calamari tasted phenomenal, as did the prosciutto. The steak was covered in gravy sauce, but the steak itself was not as good in flavor nor texture.
 ""Dinner for two"", which also included a soda, bottle of water, a tiramisu and cappuccino costed 72€, plus my voluntary tip. I probably wouldn't have tipped if I knew what was about to happen. (I always tip generously at restaurants, except when the waitstaff treats us cheaply.)
We overall enjoyed our experience at the table as a group until the end when the waiter tried to charge one of the couples in our group for additional items which they did not order. It seems as if somebody else's meal had not been paid and our friends were being pressured to pay it. During the meal, we were pleased and everyone thought it was a good place for special dinners, but after the problem with the check, we all changed our minds. 
The waiter had the audacity to tell one of the ladies in our group that paying it would not make you poor. 
He's right, but we're also not stupid. What an insult. So from a 4.5 star experience, with the 1 star treatment in the end, they get a very generous 3-star. (Only a sincere apology from the owner to our group would change my rating to 4.)","1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q",3,"2014-02-17",5,"review",0

Die guten Bewertungen im Internet, welche das Restaurant als bestes in Sindelfingen darstellen, sind teilweise Gefälligkeitsbewertungen, wie sich schon am Schreibstil leicht feststellen läßt. Zudem sind 25 Bewertungen von Personen, welche nur eine einzige Bewertung veröffentlich haben.
Doch der Reihe nach:
1. Besuch- Weihnachtsfeier unserer Firma- (ca. 25 Personen). Personal und Küche total überfordert. Getränke liefern funktionierte sehr schleppend und bis das letzte Essen kam, waren über 3 Stunden vergangen. Während sich ein Teil der Kollegen unten auf der Kegelbahn vergnügte, saßen andere da und warteten und warteten und warteten. Dabei war angekündigt, daß wir nach dem Essen gemeinsam die Kegelbahn nutzen wollen.
2.Besuch- abends mit 3 Personen- Gaststätte relativ leer, dadurch Bedienung in akzeptabler Zeit, allerdings das Essen nicht übermäßig üppig. Da ich meine Frau und einen Bekannten eingeladen hatte, empfahl ich eben noch einen Nachtisch zu nehmen. Jetzt zeigte sich etwas, was in anderen Bewertungen im Internet schon sehr häufig beschrieben wurde, die familiäre Atmosphäre des Restaurants. Der Kellner setzte sich zu bekannten Gästen an den Tisch. Der Rest des Lokals wurde ab dem Zeitpunkt ignoriert, was sowohl Speisen, als auch Getränke betraf. Nach einer halben Stunde wurde es selbst dem Koch zuviel und er kam in die Gaststube, um den Kellner darauf hinzuweisen, daß seit 30 Minuten unser Tiramisu auf die Abholung wartet.
3.Besuch -2 Paare- Im Sommer mal wieder ein Besuch. Restaurant relativ gut gefüllt und wir saßen auf der Terasse. Das man beim Bringen der Karte gleich die Getränkebestellung aufnehmen kann, war dem Kellner unbekannt, daher auch diesmal wieder lange Wartezeiten auf Essen und Getränke. Das Essen war nicht schlecht, aber so wenig, daß nicht einmal die beiden Frauem satt wurden. Unser Bekannter meinte dann auch zu seiner Angetrauten:""Eigentlich hätte ich gern mal bei Dir gekostet, aber als ich die paar Stücken auf Deinem Teller gesehen habe, habe ich mich das nicht mehr getraut."". Diesmal haben wir es dem Kellner auch mitgeteilt, daß niemand satt ist. Er empfahl uns noch Bruschetta oder Pizzataschen zu nehmen, was wir auch taten (natürlich auf Rechnung). Die anschließenden Ramazotti nach dem Essen waren natürlich brühwarm und der Getränkenachschub wie immer schleppend. Wir waren allerdings gut gelaunt und wollten uns dies auch nicht verderben lassen, so nutzen wir die Zeit um mal mit zu stoppen, wie lange die anderen Gäste so auf ihr Essen warten. Bei 2 jungen Burschen neben uns waren es anderthalb Stunden. Ein weiteres Paar fiel leider aus der Wertung, sie hatten zwar die Speisekarte erhalten, entschlossen sich aber nach ewiger Wartezeit auf die Bedienung zu gehen, daher mußten wir sie leider disqualifizieren. Irgendwann haben wir übrigens angefangen, unsere 8 leeren Gläser von Hefeweizen, Wein und Ramazotti am Tischrand in einer Reihe aufzustellen. Der Kellner verstand diesen ""dezenten"" Hinweis nicht. Das beim Kassieren das Weizenbier teurer war als ausgepreist, passte ins Bild.
4. Besuch-4 Kumpels- Ich wollte mit 3 Freunden und dem Zug in den Schwarzwald, also entschieden wir uns vor den 4 Stunden Zugfahrt noch eine Pizza zu essen. Es war Freitagmittag und die Gaststätte mittelprächtig gefüllt. Nachdem die Bedienung wieder auf sich warten lies, ging ein Freund zur Theke, um nachzufragen, ob wir in einer Stunde und 15 Minuten 4 Pizza haben könnten. Dies war laut Kellner nicht möglich. PS. Im Eiscafe Firenze am ""Berliner Platz"", wo wir anschließend hingingen, war dies trotz mittlerweile kürzerer Zeit kein Problem.

Der Veranstaltungsort war zudem mit der Sauberkeit zufrieden, mit der die Räume und die Küche vom La Romantica-Team hinterlassen wurden.","1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q",4,"2011-09-12",0,"review",0

In einen Wohngebiet im Sindelfinger Westen liegt der bekannte Italiener ""La Romantica"". Die Ambiente ist südländisch und man kommt sich vor auf der terasse vor, als wäre man in den Ferien am Gardasee.
Bedienung
Wir waren die ersten Gäste an diesen Abend, aber der Kellner war höflich und kompetent. Es gab keine Empfehlungen aber die Speisen und die Getränke kamen nach kurzer Wartezeit. 
Das Essen
Da es keine Empfehlungen vom Haus gab, haben wir die sehr umfangreiche Standardkarte eines Italiener vorgenommen. Es wurde geessen: 1x Meeresfrüchtesalat,  1 Spaghetti Carbonara, 1x Saltimbocca Romana, 1x Scaloppine pizzaliola, Dazu Mineralwasser, Pinot Grigio und Chianti.
Das Essen war außer dem Meeresfrüchtesalat lecker aber nicht sehr viel.

Wir waren am vergangenen Samstag zum Abendessen da. Wir haben dieses Lokal aufgrund von Bewertungen ausgesucht. Wir waren das erste und das letzte Mal dort. Siehe unten!
Bedienung
Wir hatten telefonisch einen Tisch für 2 bestellt. Vom Kellner wurden wir an einen Tisch platziert, der direkt neben dem Besteckschrank war. Aus diesem wurde während unseres Aufenthaltes permanent Besteck auf Teller geknallt und in gebückter Haltung an unserem Tisch vorbeigeschlichen.
Der Tisch wurde nicht vom Bestellkellner abgeräumt, sondern wortlos von einem Mann in Straßenkleidung, also mit Trenchcoat.
Das Essen
Zur Vorspeise hatten wir Carpaccio bestellt. Auf unsere Frage, ob dies mit Rucola sei, wurde selbstverständlich geantwortet. Auf meine Bitte, den Rucola wegzulassen, da ich diesen nicht mag, wurde mir geantwortet, das geht nicht,  dann machen wir es eben mit Eisbergsalat. Auf die Bitte meines Mannes, das ganze ohne Salat zu servieren ist der Kellner wortlos davongegangen. Bekommen haben wir dann ein Carpaccio, das über und über  mit rohen Champigons belegt war. Als unsere Vorspeisenteller abgeräumt wurden, wurden wir gefragt, wie es war. Meine Antwort, daß zu viele Champignons drauf waren, wurde mit einem Lächeln und Gemurmel quittiert. Ich hatte den Eindruck, daß ich nicht verstanden wurde.
Zur Hauptspeise hatte mein Mann Ravioli mit Kalbfleischfüllung mit frischen Karotten und Erbsen auf Tomatensosse. Das ganze kam sehr angetrocknet, die Karotten waren von der Form her Dose oder Glas.
Ich hatte Tagliatelle mit grünem Spargel auf einer leichten Gamba-Sahne-Sauce. Die Nudeln waren einwandfrei bissfest, die leichte Sahne-Sauce entpuppte sich als stopfende und viel zu schwere Sahne-Sauce.
Das Ambiente
Tische waren eingedeckt, Sie wurden von einer jungen Dame mit weißen Stoffhandschuhen eingedeckt; für mich in diesem Lokal völlig fehl am Platze.

Lage -  als Orientierungspunkt, das Restaurant befindet sich direkt am Wasserturm von Sindelfingen, direkt an einer relativ wenig befahrenen Durchgangstrasse . 
In der Nähe (ca. 10 Gehminuten) befindet sich eine S-Bahn Haltestelle;
Parkplatz - Mit etwas Glück in der Nähe vorhanden.
Publikum - Gemischtes Publikum,
Sehr gute Italienische Küche !
Das Lokal ist zu empfehlen !
Bedienung
Man wurde sehr freundlich und familiär begrüsst, wenn man aussen sítzen möchte, ist es ratsam vorher einen Tisch zu reservieren.
Der Kellner ging absolut auf unserer Wünsche ein. Wie z.B. eine Vorspeise, zwei Hauptgerichte zusammen, es gab automatisch 2 Teller, alles kein Problem !!!
Das Essen
Da wir das erste Mal dort hinkamen und der äussere Eindruck eher schlicht ist, umso mehr waren wir von der Qualität des Essens sehr positiv überrascht.
Wir hatten gemischte Antipasti, die lecker war. Der gemischte Salat mit hauseigenem Dressing war ebenfalls lecker. Die Krönung war, in der Kühlteke vorher zu besichtigen, das frische Lachsfilet. Garpunkt, Röststoffanteil und die Marinade - Alles Perfekt !!!! Nicht zu vergessen das Gemüse das ebenfalls sehr lecker zubereitet wurde.
Weinempfehlung: Als Erstes habe ich einen besseren Frascati getrunken. Der aber meinen Geschmack nicht entsprach. Auch hier kein Problem, der Kellner brachte eine Flasche weissen Ciro aus Sizilien öffnete ihn, obwohl wir nur 2 Gläser bestellt haben. Der Wein war überraschend frisch und nicht ölig also nicht zu schwer. Auch hier ein Volltreffer !
Es gibt auch eine eigene Pastaherstellung wo man zuschauen und natürlich bestellen kann.
Das Ambiente
Innen, einfach aber gemütlich. Aussen, sitzt man direkt an der Strasse wo ein wenig Verkehr herrscht.
Im Untergeschoss befindet sich eine Kegelbahn.

Das Lokal aussen wie innen und auch die Toiletten vermittelten einen gepflegten Zustand.","1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q",4,"2013-07-19",0,"review",0

ich hatte bereits im Dezember 2010 eine super Kritik abgegeben und melde mich nun nochmal zurück: Mein Papa hat hier seinen 50. Geburtstag gefeiert, weil es ihm bzw. uns bereits 12/10 super gefallen hatte.
 
Der 50. Geburtstag meines Vaters war im La Romantica wirklich was ganz besonderes und im Großen und Ganzen ein gelungenes Fest - dank dem Team von La Romantica... Ein ganz großes Lob möchten wir dem Chef(Koch) und seinen anderen Köchen aussprechen! Das Essen schmeckte allen 14 Gästen hervorragend (und das will was heißen, wenn man es allen 14 recht machen möchte)!!!
 
Es gibt kaum ein Restaurant in der Nähe, wo Chef und Personal so auf die Wünsche seiner Gäste eingeht wie hier in Sindelfingen... Meine bzw. unsere Meinung bleibt bestehen - super Essen, super Ambiente, tolle Vorbereitung zu entsprechenden Anlässen, 100% Verlass auf die Organisation... DAUMEN HOCH... es war für alle ein gelungener 50. Geburtstag und wir kommen wieder und empfehlen dieses Restaurant von Herzen weiter...
 
Ganz liebe Grüße an das La Romantica Team - WEITER SO...

Aus den umliegenden Hotels, z. t. Aber auch Stammgäste zu sein. Die Pizzen, die an den Nachbartischen serviert werden sind gigantisch, allein nicht zu schaffen. Ich habe mich heute eher der traditionellen ital. Küche verschrieben: Insalata Frutti Di Mare, interessant arrangiert mit viel Tintenfisch, Rukola und 2 gegrillten Garnelen, darauf Aceto Balsamicocreme : sehr lecker! Die Fritto Misto kamen dann leider Portionsweise, wobei ich das ganz witzig fand: zuerst frittierte Tintenfischringe, anschliessend Lachs und Garnelen. War wohl so nicht geplant, aber gut gekontert .

Esse gerne und oft, überall auf der Welt! Das La Romantica begeistert mit der Frische, insbesondere der selber gemachten Nudeln. Die meisten haben ""frisch"" gekaufte Nudeln aus der Packung. Gemüse war knackig, die Idee des Baybspinatsalates kreativ. Pizza , suchtgefahr wie beim Pizzabrot welches kostenlos gereicht wird. Für die Umgebung(Arbeiterstadt) gutes bis sehr gutes Preis/Leistungverhältnis. Weinauswahl sehr gut und die Preise sehr Human. Unserer Kostet in einem StuttgarterRestaurant 30% mehr. Gehen sicherlich mal wieder hin!
Bedienung
Wir waren Mittagessen und haben dieses Restaurant nun zum 3 mal aufgesucht. Die Bedienungen waren jedesmal unterschiedliche Personen, jedoch Zackig und freundlich.
Das Essen
Babyspinat Salat mit Avocado.... Alle 4 Daumen hoch. 2x  Nudeln mit Gemüse(vegetarisch) klasse. Pizza sehr üppig und wurde teilweise mitgenommen.Fleisch well done , wie bestellt und sehr weich im Schnitt und Biss.
Nachtisch , Testaktion, ohne Worte lecker!

Ich muss sagen, dass ist einer der leckersten italienischen Küchen im Umkreis Sindelfingen. Meistens wurden wir freundlich empfangen und es wurde uns ein Tisch zugewiesen. Mittlerweile haben wir unseren Stammplatz! :-)
Letztens aß meine Begleitung ein Nudelgericht mit Steinpilzen und ich hatte mir eine Dorade gegönnt. Dazu gab es einen angenehm gekühlten Weißwein (Marani). Aber von vorn, nach Empfehlung des Kellners bestellten wir uns als Vorspeise jeweils einen Babyblattspinat Salat mit Früchtedressing. Bin zwar nicht so ein Salatfreund aber ich muss zugeben es war mal was anderes und ich werde es gerne wieder bestellen. Wie schon gesagt gab es als Hauptgericht ein Nudelgericht (frische Nudeln aus der hauseigenen Nudelproduktion) mit frischen Steinpilzen. Für mich gab es eine Dorade, es war außen kross gebraten und innen zart saftig, als Beilage gab es Bratkartoffeln in Weißweinsauce. Der Wein hat fantastisch zum Essen gepaßt, so konnten wir zur 2. Flasche nicht nein sagen.
Im großen und ganzen ist das Essen und die Gastfreundschaft sehr zu empfehlen, die Einrichtung und das Ambiente sind nicht modern aber gemütlich.

"569",0,"lDbITzXjjkXYBXQ--RZwQQ","bj0ZrL2V2FTvGSrhky06-g","Aufmerksam geworden durch eine sehr positive Bewertung des Restaurants in diesem Portal, die insbesondere auf das dort bewertete Candle-Light-Dinner hinwies, entschloss ich mich meine Freundin ebenfalls mit einem solchen Dinner anlässlich eines besonderen Ereignisses zu überraschen. Ich nahm per eMail Kontakt mit dem Restaurant auf und bekam direkt Antwort vom Besitzer der gleichzeitig auch der Chefkoch ist. Mit ein paar kurzen Mails zwischen uns, klärten wir in etwa die Speisenfolge für unser Menü und letztlich versprach uns der Chef er würde uns mit einem köstlichen Fünf-Gänge-Menü überraschen. Auf diesen Deal liess ich mich ein und das war definitiv kein Fehler sondern eine gute und richtige Entscheidung.
Als wir an dem Abend im Restaurant ankamen, wartete auf uns bereits ein liebevoll mit Rosenblättern, einem Rosenstrauß und einem silbernen Kandelaber mit aprikotfarbenen Kerzen dekorierter, edel mit Stofftischdecke und Stoffservietten eingedeckter Tisch.
Der äußerst freundliche Kellner begrüßte uns und führte uns zu unsere mTisch. Unaufgefordert brachte er uns dann sogleich je ien Glas Prosecco als Aperitiv und zum Anstossen auf den Abend. In diesem Moment erschien auch der Chef selbst. Er kam aus der Küche, begrüßte uns ebenfalls sehr freudnlich und erläuterte uns mit welchen Genüssen er uns nun zu verwöhnen gedachte.
Die Speisenfolge die er für uns ausgesucht hatte war folgende:
1. Lachstranchen auf Weißbrot mit gedünsteten Gemüsestreifen 2. Vitello Tonnato mit selbstgebackenem Pizzaofenbrot3. Teigtaschen gefüllt mit Ricotta-Scampi-Lachs-Farce auf karamellisiertem Spinatbett4. Gegrillter Wolfsbarsch an würziger Orangensauce mit Pizzaofenbrot5. Panna Cotta auf Kramellspiegel
Dazu empfahl er uns als Getränk einen Weisswein, den wir allerdings nach kurzer Diskussion (da wir lieber Rotwein trinken) in einen 2003er Vino Nobile di Montepulciano umwandelten.
Die Speisen die gereicht wurden, waren alle von erlesener Qualität und Frische. Jeder Gang - das war deutlich erkennbar - war vom Chef mit Kreativität und Hingabe zubereitet worden.
Die Speisen waren auf Geschirr unterschiedlicher Form, sehr dekorativ und liebevoll angerichtet und waren köstlich im Geschmack. Die Mengen waren eher zu großzügig denn zu knapp bemessen und wir konnten meist die jeweilige Menge nicht vollständig verzehren.
Das äußerst aufmerksame und dennoch sich dezent im Hintergrund  haltende Servicepersonal, sorgte dafür dass immer die Gläser mit Wein (der natürlich dekantiert worden war und in einem Dekanter gereicht wurde) und auch Wasser gefüllt waren, sowie wurde stets dezent nachgefragt, ob die Speisen und auch alles andere zu unserer Zufriednheit sei und ob ggf. etwas zusätzliches - wie z.B. ein Espresso zwischendurch - gereicht werden dürfe.
Die absolute Krönung dieses ohnehin genial positiven gastronomischen Erlebnisses kam am Schluss, nach dem köstlichen Dessert, als der Chef aus der Küche sich - nach vorherigem Fragen selbstverständlich - mit zu uns an den Tisch sass, uns noch einen hervorragenden Grappa als Digestive und auf Kosten des Hauses anbot.
Vorher hatte er allerdings noch gefragt, ob er ein Foto von uns an diesem besondern Abend machen und uns noch ein Geschenk zum mitnehmen anbieten dürfe.
Kurz, das Foto diente dazu von ihm auf ein T-Shirt gedruckt zu werden, das er uns als Abschiedsgeschenk überreichte und dabei sehr ehrlcih sich dafür bedankte, dass wir seine Gäste waren und ihn und seine Speisen und sein Team gelobt haben.
Der absolute Knaller kam nun aber ganz zum Schluss, als ich eher im Spass erwähnte, dass ich aufgrund des doch mehr als erwarteten Genusses von Prosecco, Wein und Grappa nun wohl doch ein Taxi rufen müsse und meinen Wagen dann eben am nächsten Morgen irgendwie abholen müsse. Da bot sich der Chef spontan an, natürlich nur wenn es uns recht wäre, uns mit unserem eigenen Wagen nach Hause zu fahren und sein Chefkellner mit seinem Wagen hinterher, so daß er wieder zurück kommen würde.
Wir haben das tatsächlich so gemacht und ich kann nur sagen, die Jungs und Mädels im La Romantica sowie das was sie bieten ist allererste Klasse und man wird so etwas und vor allem so eine Einstellung so leicht nirgendwo sonst finden!
Eines ist sicher, wann immer wir künftig in der Nähe sein werden, werden wir sicher dort wieder einkehren und ich bin fast sicher, vermutlich wie alte Freunde begrüßt und verwöhnt werden!
Fazit: Nicht nur empfehelnswert sondern ein absolutes Muss für jeden Gourmet und Freund italienischer Gastfreundlichkeit!
Übrigens, es soll nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass der zu entrichtende Preis für diesen genialen Abend inkl. allen Getränken usw. mit rund 100€ auch wohl als mehr als preiswert zu bewerten ist.","1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q",5,"2010-03-05",0,"review",0

Ich hatte die guten Bewertungen gelesen und beim Restaurant angefragt, ob am gleichen Abend noch ein Tisch verfügbar wäre und ob ich ein Candle Light Dinner buchen könnte. Man kann das Dinner mit einem 4 oder 5 Gänge Menü bestellen. Ich entschied mich für das 5 Gänge Menü (im Nachhinein hätten 4 auch gereicht, wir waren pappsatt). Der Koch erklärte uns persönlich die Menüfolge und gab eine Weinempfehlung. Auch Sonderwünsche (statt Apprikosenkompott wollte sie Erdbeerkompott) wurden berücksichtigt... für die Erdbeeren ist der Koch noch einmal extra in einen gegenüberliegenden Markt gelaufen ... einfach spitze. 
Der Tisch war mit Rosenblättern verziert, welche ein großes Herz bildeten. Ein 5facher Kerzenleuchter und ein paar Blumen machten den Abend perfekt. Das Essen war super und auch nicht all zu teuer. Für das 5-Gänge Menü + 2x 0,2 Karaffen Wein + 1L Wasser bezahlte ich ca. 80 Euro. Als Bonus machte der Koch noch ein gemeinsames Foto von uns und druckte es auf ein Tshirt für nur 10 Euro. Das war eine schöne Überraschung für meine Freundin und die 10 Euro alle mal Wert. 
Der Service war erstklassig, alle 5 Minuten schaute eine Kellnerin aus der Entfernung ob wir mit dem Gang fertig waren oder ob wir noch zu trinken hatten. Das war spitze. So gut bin ich noch niemals bedient worden, was sich auch in meinem Trinkgeld wiederspiegelte :)

Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first, but he wolfed it down eventually. My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm. This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold. The toast was so smeared with butter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it. Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too. He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns. They were delicious. Granddaughter liked her kids' menu French toast and ate most of it. My coffee was good, but I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar.

Our waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes. She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again. We said yes again. She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly. The place was busy, so maybe she was overworked, but we ended up feeling rushed too. 

Our waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card. Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), ""We don't combine cards!"" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones. She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp. We never did get that second extra stamp, but by that time, we were done with her. We left a minimal tip.

Today's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality. We go only if we have coupons. Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again.

The owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff. 

Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner. 

So.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please. 

The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere. 

The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.  

I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc.. My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items. I believe kid menu items are 99 cents when an adult purchases an entree on M-F. If not M-F, I know for sure kids are 99 cents on Fridays.","6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA",4,"2012-10-27",0,"review",0

I've never been overly impressed with 5 and Diner in the past, and I have to say, they met my mediocre expectations this round as well. My wife ordered the pancake sandwich with two eggs and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with raisin toast. None of which was better than what you can make at home, but it wasn't disappointing either.

Overall, the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills. However, here's where the problem comes in. When my wife ordered the pancake sandwich the server asked my wife ""do you like bacon or sausage"", to which she replied ""bacon"". Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said ""the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra"". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on. The food was decent, but I have a big problem with dishonest servers and that's what knocks this place down from being a decent breakfast joint to just another bump on the road of mediocre cuisine.","6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA",2,"2011-04-11",3,"review",0

Okay, it's the sweet and sassy waitress.  She can sell me anything.  Even dessert, when I am not hungry.

The food is mediocre.  I recommend sticking with breakfast items.  On this last visit, we ordered dinner.  The pot pie was okay and included a big dinner salad for about $8.  Not bad.  

I somehow ended up spending $40+ for two adults and two kids on my last visit, even though kids were supposed to be 99 cents with the purchase of each adult entree.  

Part of the inflated check was that the aforementioned waitress upsold the dessert to us at $3.99 per slice of cake or pie.  Let me review that dessert now.

Carrot cake?  Nearly inedible.  With two people splitting a piece, 1/3 of it got eaten.  It tasted like it had been in a freezer.  DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.  The 9 year old girl who ordered it said... ""this does not even taste like carrots.""  I thought it tasted like a dry spice cake that had been frozen for a few months and then defrosted on the counter overnight.  

Cherry pie?  YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.  If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem.

Still, the atmosphere is cute.  The decor is interesting for the kids.

However, I have now had two disappointing meals at the diner at the Arizona MIlls in Tempe. Today's lunch was a terrible affair.

We arrived at about 12:30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied. What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but. It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and then a very long time for our meal.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer.

My burger was beyond well done, and dry, but greasy from the cheese and sauces. Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce. I was hungry and waited too long to bother sending it back. I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries.

M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy! So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right.

This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate. The fries were good don't get me wrong. The sliders were okay. There was only meat and cheese on them. The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions. Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them. Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt. It wasn't malty. It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt. Service was just okay. We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there. Biggest complaint: It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C.

Finally a guy came over (may have been the manager) and said,""what can I get you?"" That's it. No ""Hi"" or ""are you ready to order?"". I was a little turned off at that point. I would've left since I was already annoyed at how long we were ignored for (I've done that before, you can tell when you're about to get crappy service) but the kids were ""starving"".

Anywho, my patty melt was ok. I've had better. Fries were pretty good.

We were hungry, and 5 & Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.

Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up. It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.

Stepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.

Despite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.

So if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after. Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",3,"2010-11-23",4,"review",4

Food- I came here the night before Easter Sunday. So, I was not able to try any of the meat dishes.  The food is a bit disappointing. After you have the tapas at Firefly, it is difficult  to match the quality, quantity and taste of the food. 

Location-The location is great. Across from Blue Martini and steps away from the movie theaters. Town square is a great location. 

Price- A bit on the steep side. You do not get enough bang for your buck. You cannot really expect much because of the expensive rent  these places have to pay at Town Square. 

Service - It is OK, nothing special.

I have to say that this should be ""the"" spot of the summer (for drinks). It has a central location, Miami-ish décor, balcony that overlooks the Town Square park, and two additional balconies on both sides that are all perfect for people watching. Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot. 
However, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand. 

What was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.

The sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly. As a matter of fact we ordered about ten different items on the menu and maybe the only thing that stood out was the mushroom ceviche and the dates with bacon (even though Firefly's is better but how do you mess up something with bacon wrapped around it anyway). Everything else was ... eh and will not have me running back there to eat. With places that have waaaaayyyy better food within walking distance (Johhny McGuire's, Yardhouse, Bar Louie, and even Cadillac Ranch) I'd rather eat somewhere else and afterwards go grab a couple drinks at night here.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",3,"2010-03-07",1,"review",1

This was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time. 

When my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food. 

The first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab. 

Finally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent. 

I was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it. I would hate for them to suffer through this meal. It was awful. Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor. 

I will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely. Wouldn't be bad to stop in for a beer before or after a movie. I just wouldn't eat. Not sure this place will stay open long, it was pretty empty when we went, and, in the words of the hostess, reservations aren't really needed.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",1,"2010-02-13",2,"review",2

I didn't try much of their menu, save for their beef empenadas.  I found them to be tasty and well cooked.  Since I stuck with that, the pricing was respectable.  I had also tried their ""Fire Water"" drink based off the name alone, and I found it to be enjoyable as well.  A bit of a small glass, but the flavor was good.

I don't want to rate it any higher on the grounds that I only had one menu and drink selection, and they were more of a quick snack than a full meal, but my friend and I enjoyed our individual meal selections, and the overall vibe and view were pleasant.

Perhaps in returning at a later time, I'd be able to make a more concrete decision on where I want to place my enjoyment factor, but the first impression was pleasant enough to want to check it out again.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",4,"2010-05-02",1,"review",1

But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your ""foodie"" DNA. This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said ""I wish I could try 5 plates"".  Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.

If you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?) 

- Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi/fish ""cooked"" in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?) 

Shrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop. 

Short ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender. 

Piggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have. 

- Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people. ""Not as sweet"" as most. 

Lastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult. 

I want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square. 

Gun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason. 

I think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend, ""I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had"" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it.

I know everyone on Yelp is obsessed with Firefly, but I can now confidently say I much prefer Cana! Before I get onto the main review, a few reasons why this place kicks Firefly's butt:

*Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks. I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.

*Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly

*Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise. 

--------------------------

I've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.

We've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.

On the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce. 

If you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better! You might just like it .","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",5,"2010-02-23",5,"review",4

We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.

These are the tapas we ordered:
-Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.

-Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum

-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.

-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.

-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.

-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.

-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.

-Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.

-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.

-Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.

-Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.

Sopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.  

Sugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.  

Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...

So, happy hour is definitely the time to go to try out many different tapas and drink the sugarcane sangria.  I will come back!","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",4,"2011-01-18",1,"review",2

My boyfriend and I got a pitcher of mojiots, empanadas, and a sorry excuse for a flatbread which was basically three slices of pita bread with a little smudge of melted cheese in the center... no sauce, no flavor. This cost us $75 after tip. We left still starving after a day of laying by the pool in the sun, and grumpy for wasting money. 
The only reason I gave two stars as opposed to one, is because I saw the bartender totally hook it up in our pitcher of mojito. He probably used half the bacardi bottle on us. 
But, needless to say, we met up with friends right after this, and immediately walked over to Brio for some hearty pasta, breads, and salads.

About the Restaurant:
Mojitos... Great.
Tapa style plates.... Great. I tried: 
The Ceviche: Lychee/lime/lavender
The flatbread pizza: Grilled Chicken/mango/cilantro/queso blanco
The Mac & Cheese: with Habaner jace (my favorite)
The Lamb Chops: with mint chimichurri (okay, also my favorite)
Tried two of the three desserts: Bread Pudding with banana/rum sauce and the Chocolate Kiss, with Chipolte Foam... was not a fan of the foam...

Service was outstanding, this was the second night they were open... so i hope they keep this up. Very friendly. 

Atmosphere was nice/modern/chic, I could use a brighter candle on the table... i had to use my iphone for light to read the menu... but they noticed right away, and said they would be working on it.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",4,"2010-01-26",0,"review",0

Went here for DINNER last night with some friends. 

Ambiance: 
low lighting, dark woods, modern feel, one big open room with tables plus outdoor patio seating which looked like it would be a great way to go in the Fall and Spring... they had cool (I thought they were cool) paper-like, scrunched lanterns hanging from the ceiling 

Menu: 
2-page menu.... 1-page for drinks and 1-page for food 
What's cool is that they keep it simple but it's not a far reaching menu like some other tapas places I've been to... and if you're vegetarian this is NOT the place for you... I think there were 2 items on the menu that did not have meat or were meat based 

Downside: (and this is why I'd give them 3 stars) they were out of a number of items 
- out of all but 2 wines 
- out of 2 of the 8 beers 
- out of the short rib tacos and some other dish that I can't remember 

Taste: 
Excellent... everything we ordered was very tasty and well executed with a flair for presentation. 
Note: the portions are not super big.... so each plate is good for 2 people... we often ordered multiples. 

Enjoyed the Tuna Ceviche... Chicken Empanadas (now these were on the big side).... Chicken Tacos... Fish Tacos... Crispy Shrimp 

Dessert: 
WOW! If you like bread pudding... or even if you are just mildly interested.... try their Banana Bread Pudding.... YUM! It doesn't look like much when it comes out... but then you take a bite. Oh MY! :) 
We also ordered the Churros which were more like Cinnamon twists.. nevertheless... very good as well and I dipped the churros in the sauce the BBP came in... oh Yea! 

Service: 
Our waiter was cool.... super busy as it seemed like he was only 1 of 2 guys taking care of all the tables and it was a pretty busy night... almost all the tables were filled plus a big party of 10 
The hostess was ... I guess... I'd say indifferent... she wasn't mean but she wasn't friendly either so.... 

Drinks: 
I ordered the raspberry mojito... and to me ... it was way too sweet... I personally think it needed more rum and less sugarcane but that's me. Plus they muddled the heck out of it so that there weren't pieces of fruit swimming around as I had expected... I like the chunks of fruit in my muddled mojito... I know... I'm strange. 

The white sangria however was FABULOUS... it too was sweet but in a different way. I know... that doesn't make sense... so let's just say this drink would be perfect for sitting by the pool .... refreshing and delightful. 

All in all... we'll go back... it's different from the norm and I want to try their Red Sangria.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",4,"2011-01-21",1,"review",1

Much better than Firefly where the dates are served soaking in a bowl of bacon grease (although I have to admit that Firefly introduced me to this dish so I shoudln't complain).

The best part about my experience was the service. John is an amazing bar tender. All of the bartenders are very friendly and focused on the customer. They were genuinely interested in whether or not we liked our food and drinks. John introduced us to Cory, the owner, who is also a friendly, genuine person.  I don't think you'll find better service anywhere in Vegas, really. I have been going to Firefly for years and have never left feeling like the employees knew me or cared about my return. It's the opposite at Cana.

We're told not to worry since we'd be sheltered from the wind. We get outside and we asked to sit at the only table located in the sun. 

As we are looking at the menu and finally warm up, the hostess comes back to our table and asked us to move to another table in the shade since apparently, the table in the sun is going to be used by the big party. Which by the way, we have yet seen.

I had far more food that I normally do but was glad I tried out so many things.  I'll list it out since my eyes were very hungry that night.:

Hamachi - fresh and zesty
Duck Empanada - delicious unique butter crust and sweet to bite
Mac N Cheese - so bad for you but so good when it hits your lips
Calamari - crispy and peppery and using the dipping sauce really adds to the flavor
Pork Chops - Loved the marinade, tender, and full of flavor
Bread Pudding - This hit all my senses as soon as it hit the table and really lived up to expectations
Churros - Best churro I've ever had, arrived warm and hot and the glaze just really made the flavor jump in you mouth.

My friend had the white wine sangria and was very satisfied which is quite the compliment since she's very discerning.  I had a faux-jito, which was equally flavorful and fun.

Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):

Beef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half.
Mac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people.
Cuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price.
Crispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share.
Chicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night.
Sangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.

During my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.  Cana's food is good from what I've tasted so far, but the prices are scaring me off from trying the other items, no matter how good they look.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",3,"2010-04-21",1,"review",1

The service was good, and the ambiance is contemporary and inviting, however it's not the kind of place to indulge in, just feeling like snacking and paying $70 a person for basically an appetizer.

First of all, there are 2 entries for Caña on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.

Now for the review... Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the ""behind the bar"" area before getting to the dining area. With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.

As for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even ""really good"" either.

- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.

- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.

- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.

- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.

- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.

- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.

We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Caña might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",3,"2010-02-14",1,"review",1

The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture. The chicken flat bread was sparse. The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream). The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked.

We ordered cocktails and our food, we ordered their Meatballs, Spring Rolls, Mac & Cheese, and the Dates. We ordered these because they're are favorites from Firefly so we could compare. And we thusly found out there was no comparison. Cana's offerings were ok, but nothing outstanding. The food really felt like someone was reading receipts out of a cookbook and attempting to add their own ""flair"".

Firefly is still the king of Tapas Eateries in Las Vegas for me, Cana's was a disappointment.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",2,"2010-11-25",3,"review",1

The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful..each and every time!  The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio.  They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room.  Perfect!

This visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu. (Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie...new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried but let's just say one of them bit me!  There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.  

Speaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.  

But even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.  You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids.  I think I ate them all, but sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember.

Things to try: the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips!

And thanks Cory and GM (Ben I think?) for making our visit so entertaining, educational and above all...FUN!","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",5,"2010-04-24",0,"review",0

My father and I arrived for happy hour at 6 and were told it had just ended! Luckily the cordial manager Mike let us indulge in happy hour since their yelp ad lists happy hour from 4-7pm.

First off, their happy hour prices are so inexpensive!! I posted pictures of the menus- beer $3, Cocktails 4.50, and a glass of wine for $3.50? Absolutely awesome.

The watermelon gazpacho was pleasing, but the flavours weren't really intermingled well. One bite would be incredibly delicious, and the next sort of bland. I definitely wouldn't write it off though.

Our cocktails were the highlight; my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor. The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria. Sierra Mist is the contributing sweetness : /

There was also an interesting selection of South American Beers!

Their Hamachi Tiradito was a winner, and entirely cooked as opposed to raw. Raw might have been more delicious, but sashimi isn't exactly tapas.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",3,"2010-11-29",2,"review",1

However our server asked the chef who agreed to let us order from the dinner menu if there was something we were interested in (our group of 5). Ceviche-tapas style items were all very good and we were quite pleased. We stayed inside because it was a bit cold outside, but the view (of Townsquare) from the deck looked nice.

My preliminary explanation is that people love sugar cane in their drinks; they love it so much that they are driven in a sugar frenzy to giving 4 or more stars. I can respect this. I didn't have any sugar cane drinks. I had a glass of wine and some food.

The atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere, but at Cana you pay for the atmosphere. The food was expensive for tapas. We had a ceviche, which was decent. I had no real complaints there, but some of my friends did not think it was the freshest. Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread. For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the ""crispy"" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.  

I am willing to grant that perhaps I came on an off night. There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff. If I am at Town Square and someone wants to go back, I wouldn't be a party pooper. However, for now and based on the other reviews, I would say go to Cana for the drinks, but eat at Firefly. The food at Firefly is 50% cheaper and 100% hotter.","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",2,"2010-03-19",12,"review",5

We decided on a pitcher of the Sugarcane Sangria. The server told us that it was cheaper getting the pitcher, but beware this is full price during happy hour. We also ordered the Mac and Cheese and the Chicken Empanada (this is not a HH item). I thought both were decent, but I definitely would say I wasn't impressed.

We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say ""sorry you just missed Happy Hour"". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good. For sure it won't be until summer. I hate eating in a winter coat. Maybe by summer they will have better service and people watching?","8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA",3,"2011-01-10",1,"review",1

The waitress that brought our food was different from the one who took our order, so seemed confused when I pointed out the steak was missing. However, she came back promptly with a big plate of steak to add to my salad and said it was ok, because my server had it down right but the kitchen missed it.

The owners of this place own several places in town, some great and some ok, so they obviously could care less what I had to say.  It is about the food!  If you make great food then people will come.

I am a sucker for trying every new place around, despite the countless bad reviews I read.  Cabo''s was the latest of the new places I've tried.  Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible.  Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated..  Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok.  

If nothing was horrible then why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them.  I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here. The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing.  However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food.  They charge $13.00 for a Fajita and $3.00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it.  That is $16 for a Fajita that would be $9-$12 everywhere else.  

The food was not horrible, but it was bland.  The fajitas lacked flavor.  I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something.  When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero then you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant. 

The service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent.  I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background.   This is usually a worrisome sign for me at any ethnic restaurant, particularly at a Mexican restaurant.  This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated, but I doubt it.  The employees I encountered were pleasant, but the experience was nothing special.  Before you bash me as some white hating individual I must disclose that I'm white.  I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food, but rarely is it ever as good as a person from that particular ethnic background (in this case Mexican). 

With all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?  I won't, I'll take my business and money elsewhere where I can get a better meal for less.  If you must try it then go ahead as it won't be a horrible experience, but don't say that you weren't warned.","1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w",2,"2014-04-20",2,"review",0

John, the general manager, was professional and very friendly upon my initial inquiry and throughout the meal. My group ate in the small area to the right just inside the main door.

The service? It could not have been better. Angela and Joy spoke with me prior to the arrival of the other guests to make sure that everything was set up properly and to make sure that the guests would get the best possible service. They did a great job of getting drinks and food orders, offering suggestions, and generally having fun with the diners. Chips and drinks were refilled quickly and all the service was with a smile.

Everyone enjoyed their meal. We ordered quite an array of entrees from tacos to fajitas. My meal, the stuffed poblano pepper, was excellent. Angela suggested adding spicy pork to it, but I was determined to have a meat-free meal today. The next time I will definitely try her suggestion. I thought the queso we ordered for our chips was outstanding. People gobbled up the fresh guacamole, which I personally thought needed just a bit more heat. The other suggestion one person made was that his meal also could have used a bit more heat. Needless to say, everyone left quite full and satisfied.

After lunch, a few of us relaxed at the bar, making for a great ending to a wonderful experience. Great food, great service and reasonable prices: quite a combination for a Mexican restaurant on the southwest side of Champaign.

We stopped in for an early dinner. We left filled and satisfied.  The food was very good and we will definitely be back. We had cheese curds as an appetizer. They were tasty, but they are breaded and then deep fried and served with a sauce. The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper.  Truly good sauce.  The curds themselves were unexceptional. Too much breading, but that seems common in this part of the country.  (We prefer curds warm and ""naked"" with a spice ""rub"" rather than a sauce. But I'm not complaining. They were good.)

The main courses likewise were really good. The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream. But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine.  The squash tacos were a real surprise, especially at a restaurant like this. They were spicy and perfectly done. Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas.  The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings. Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any.  It was piled high and easily shared. And, most important, it was delicious.

The chips and salsa were good. The salsa, in fact, was very good. Especially the hot salsa. It was a tomatillo salsa but with lots of peppers but still not really hot.  The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was. None in our party found it exceptional.  The chips were warm and very salty. I couldn't tell for certain, but I don't believe they are made on the premises.  

The menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos. And there are many choices in each category. Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much.  It isn't really Mexican; if you are looking for authentic Mexican you should go to Maize or El Charro. The food here is Mexican Inspired. I'm not knocking it. It is delicious. The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more authentic places. The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks.  And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables. 

The place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack: a lovely decor. Although says Cantina and Grill on the sign, this is a sit-down restaurant if you want it to be.  On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those ""tall tables"" that require high chairs to sit at.  The decor is simple but very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it.  There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days.  

The wait staff was wonderful. They would explain any dish you might have questions about, and they make recommendations if you give them guidelines about what you are looking for in a meal.  Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week.  

Parking is ample and we were seated immediately. The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask.

All in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign! I suspect it will become one of our regular stops.","1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w",5,"2013-11-22",4,"review",1

Next, I had the most amazing spinach salad. There was a mild curry flavor and the tangerines and onions made it so crisp and fresh! That has been the best salad I have ever had. But I have to say, that the winner of it all for me at least is the sauce that came with the cheese curds. I am calling it the ""Magic Sauce"". I hope the owners would start bottling that sauce and having it for sale. I would definitely stock my pantry up with it. 
What I liked most is the variety they had. I even had a fabulous burger that was mildly spiced and had a cumin type flavor to it.

The tacos are described as spicy, and they were - way hot cayenne.  Service was OK, rushed, but everything got there.  The second trip was way better, service was friendly, and relaxed.  They were not as crowded.  We had burgers, and steak tacos.  I had the Black Jack burger with fried jalapeno, cheese, and two beef patties.

This place will continue to get better as the staff settles in, and the kitchen gets sorted out.","1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w",4,"2014-01-12",0,"review",0

I went there for lunch with some co-workers.  The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in.  The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn't that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made ""in house so they are extra yummy.""  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.

They have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price/one size.  This was disappointing.

I ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.

The burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then ""grill"" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that's not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.  Don't waste your time or money.

I prefer to support locally owned business, especially restaurants since I worked in the industry for a long time, but this was just overall a very bad experience.","1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w",1,"2013-12-31",1,"review",0

After quickly looking over the menu we both decided on getting the chimichanga. (My personal favorite) It seemed like the food took a bit longer than we were expecting but not too bad.

Once our order arrived, it looked delicious. However, that was not the case. As others have mentioned, the black beans have an off taste. The rice is pretty bland and underwhelming. Both the rice and beans were cold. The chimichanga is filled mostly with rice and beans which didn't help. Unfortunately, the entire meal was just rather mediocre.

Although the food wasn't the greatest, you do get large portions. My girlfriend and I decided if we tried coming again, we might just split an entree. She said she would give the restaurant 3 out of 5.

Honestly, I couldn't recommend going here. The food just wasn't that good. Hopefully, they can improve and perhaps we can try it again.","1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w",2,"2014-02-16",1,"review",0
"695",0,"gF37cxBOnIi3ZoC6FKmu-Q","LVMdHcurRep_3F0yO6jv3A","Champaign is full of middling but not terrible places for Mexican food. You get your food in seconds, but it's pretty much just the same ingredients shuffled around in different combinations, and each component is not all that great. Not BAD, but not great. I think this is the first truly great place for Mexican I've eaten at in Champaign, which is why I'm throwing caution to the wind and actually giving it a full five stars.

I just started going a few weeks ago, and I've been there three times since. I've always found the wait staff to be really pleasant. They do get pretty busy during dinner, but I've never had a terrible wait and usually get seated right away. It might help that I tend to eat dinner a little earlier, if possible.

You get chips and salsa, of course, to start at no charge. Their chips were fresh and light and warm. Nothing is a bad sign like bad tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. I have tried the guacamole and the queso. Of the two, I preferred the queso as an add-on dip for the Nachos. The guacamole was okay, but it could have used more lime, and I prefer my guac a bit chunkier.

Possibly the best thing on their menu are their crisps, which are like little mini-pizzas on a tortilla-based ""crust."" The crust of them is perfect. Delicate and flaky and crispy, which you'd hope based on the name. I've had bites of two different crisps-the pork and the red pepper varieties. I preferred the pork overall, but both were full of flavor. Their cheese and sauces seem of a very good quality and are very flavorful.

I've also tried their pork tacos. The tortillas uses for their tacos (white corn, I believe) are great. Soft, with a little bit of texture and tooth to them. I did think their pork could used a tad more heat, but other than that they made a good lunch portion with the chips.

Desert-wise, you must try their fried ice-cream! It's the best I've ever had. It seems like a hard thing to mess up too badly, but plenty of Mexican places that bother to offer it, do. It has a sweet, flaky crust and delicious chocolate drizzle. It might be nice if you got two coated, smaller scoops of ice cream instead of one larger one, just to balance out the crust and ice cream proportions a bit better. Still, it's delicious.

As far as drinks go, I have had two of their Margaritas. The first was a Blackberry and Basic concoction, and was my favorite of the two. I didn't get a ton of basil from it, but there was enough there to make it interesting. The other was a pineapple and coconut Margarita. This had a great taste, though I didn't get much coconut from it other than the toasted coconut on the rim of the glass. Neither skimped on the alcohol.","1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w",5,"2014-01-20",3,"review",0

Food: HOLF SH*T SALTY. I mean SALTY. Like hey, want some food as a side to your jug of morton's salt with that? Now, I am not one of those people on a low sodium diet, where you body goes into shock consuming salt. I consider myself having a pretty normal diet. The guacamole was salty. Black beans couldn't even taste beans because it was sooo salty. Rice was mushy and had no flavor at all. I tried my husband's chicken burrito, and it was salt with chicken essence. We wouldn't even bag it up for our dogs to eat. I had the cheese enchiladas. HORRIBLE. It was like a really bad quesadilla with some red sauce on it. No use of Mexican cheeses-- just really shitty kraft cheese that my knife wouldn't even cut through. 

Service: Meh. Had to ask the bartenders for menus as no one was coming to our table. Server was new and didn't know the menu when we had a couple questions. When she saw that I only ate a bite of my food, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong or how she could fix it. Big no no. I was a server for 5 years and you just know when something isn't right with your customers. 

Drinks: Meh. I had the blackberry margarita, which tasted of only blackberry syrup. Needed to be cut with fresh lime juice. 

We left with both of us wanting to throw up and head to the sauna to sweat out the salt. Seriously eating bad Chinese food and a bunch of sunflower seeds would still be less salt than this place. 

Basically if you like suburb quality Mexican food that uses frozen and not fresh ingredients come here.","1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w",1,"2013-12-15",2,"review",0

Once we ordered then we waited what seemed like a very long time to get our food.  The food was not edible.  The black beans were chalky and cold and had a funny flavor.  They serve the Chimichanga with rice and beans on the outside and on the inside.  I ordered a chicken Chimichanga but all that was in it was rice and beans and not very good rice and beans either!  

I ordered a classic margarita and it was good but it's about a 4 ounce glass and cost $7.  Get real!!!!

The inside is really nice (just like Smoke Que and Brew) but the service and the food suck!  I will not go back for a second try to this place.

The menu is just great.  Lets talk drinks first.  I'm definitely a margarita lover so having Cabo's wide selection was awesome! Instead of regular sour mix they make fresh lime juice and organic agave nectar! How cool! The Roasted Blackberry and Basil Margarita by far is delicious. This combo goes great together.  However, my personal favorite is the Platinum Margarita. Instead of Triple sec, this one calls for a high quality and tasty ingredient called Grand Marnier--it makes the flavor so much better!

So food. To start off, the chips and salsa must be good at a Mexican place, and this place surely scores a 10 by me! The stuffed poblano is really what hits the spot for me, but I do love a good taco! And this is definitely the place for that!

Overall this place is a winner for me. Everyone is so nice, food is great, and the drinks are awesome! I really can't wait for warm weather so the patio is open!","1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w",5,"2014-01-14",0,"review",0

The service was great - full service from the moment you pull up to when you leave (loading your clubs, cleaning them when you're done, etc.).  The grounds crew were super-friendly as you encountered them during your round.

The course was in excellent shape - it's no secret that they care and put a lot of work into each and every hole.  There are varying holes with lots of character.  

It can be a challenging course if you're not hitting straight.  The rough can get pretty thick if you're off the fairway.  If you're off the rough, you're in trouble as the tall fescues make it imposslbe to get your club down to the ball - take a drop and move along.  

The clubhouse is immaculate and beautiful.  As you come up #18, the view of the facilities is impressive.  The view from the clubhouse down to the course is equally impressive.

A round here can be expensive, but make no mistake, they'll treat you like royalty here.  If you don't mind droping a few bucks, pamper yourself here for a day - you won't regret it.","4_X7bpnWV_VBcp7JQBvlWQ",4,"2014-05-27",1,"review",1

The first thing you notice as you walk up the stairs to the hostel is the homey atmosphere of the place. It actually feels like a home - the tiny kitchen with the wooden cupboards and drawers, the ""chill room"" with the musical instruments, and curtains just hanging in the 22 bed dorm. The place is kept very clean and tidy. 

The crowd of people who stay there were also pretty awesome. Some people were playing the instruments, others were playing card games, while others were cooking up delicious meals. It's a great place to meet some people to chill out and/or to explore the city together. 

The staff were also very friendly and approachable. They don't actually have 24hr reception there though, but they leave instructions in front of the door so you can get in the house any time of the day.  

The hostel was located right in the heart of the Old Port of Montreal, where most of the tourist attractions there. The Old Port is a gorgeous place to wander about at night. 

One bad thing is that the Internet was extremely slow when I was there (and it didn't work half the time), but this is something they may have fixed since then. There is also a pretty decent coffee shop down the road with Internet, so it's really not a big deal.","68s1OlziLPXKvdwBLV_pGw",4,"2013-03-25",1,"review",0

The room was surprisingly nice, with windows looking out front. It was just under $80 for the two of us to have a private room. Given that this was my first hostel experience, I was quite pleased and made me think again about my thoughts on hostels.

The only somewhat negative thing I have to say is that because it's an old building, the windows aren't insulated and you can hear everything going on outside on the street, and also it gets a little chilly in the room. And the walls are thin and you can also hear everyone else in their rooms/common area, so if you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs.

On my last trip here, I came with some friends to get some food in our systems before/during/after beers. We all three ordered the meal which consisted of a slice of pizza, a delicious side, and a drink. In my case, I got a pepperoni pizza, toasted mini potatoes, and a Pepsi. I should mention that they had like 5 different kids of pizza ready to serve up (pepperoni, ham/pineapple, cheese, sausage, jalapeno, stuffed...) which they warm up for you really quickly before serving it. As for the quality of my pizza? It was good. It was nothing to write home about, but it was good. I think the crust was kinda bland, but otherwise I was happy with it. The little potatoes they served me were pretty good, too. My friends ordered the pasta on the side, and they were happy with their food selections as well. As a matter of fact, they were happy enough with their sides that they ate them before the pizza and said it was a 5-star meal, though I was erring on the side of 3. (Thus the four-star rating)

I think it's an enormous rip off, and I do not shop here for my usual grocery hauls. However, this Giant Eagle is right by my house, so whenever I need to run to the store for a random item or two (usually 2-4x per month), this is where I go. 

This Giant Eagle is very clean, well stocked, and has a very good selection. Their bakery, sushi, already prepared foods (like rotisserie chickens), salad bar, and wine selection are really nice. They also offer a lot of items that I have a hard time finding at other stores (a certain yogurt, bread, etc.) 

The employees at this location are split about 50/50. Half are nice and/or competent, and the other half are either rude and/or don't know what they are doing. For example, I was in there one day in the 12 items or less line, and this lady was trying to buy individual clementines. The cashier said they didn't sell individual clementines and wondered where she got them. Two other employees were also there (one was checking out, and another was from the self checkout area), and no one knew where these clementines were from. So theyre just holding up the already long line trying to figure it out when I informed them that they're the free ones that are for kids while parents are shopping. I hardly even come here and I knew that, lol. Really? Three employees had no clue? 

Another time I called to place a cake order, and apparently it was a real inconvenience to the bakery lady who was super rude evvvery step of the process. But whatever, the white cake with the satin (whipped) frosting from GE is so delicious that I'm willing to put up with rude employees to get it. 

But, I'll still give this location 4 stars because it's not a bad store, it's clean, and they're always stocked. The prices are a rip off, and they could use more cashiers, especially during busy times- but what grocery store doesn't have that problem. The parking also sucks because all of the people are whipping in and out of the parking lot in their luxury vehicles going to and from Crocker Park, Giant Eagle, and all the other shops in the vicinity, but if you like to live on the edge, it's not too big of a deal.","5kCRty4p7tBwM9P7MAXgvA",4,"2016-05-14",0,"review",0

On the plus side, it is larger than many of the other Giant Eagles and, since it has more space, offers a better selection of many items than you get at the smaller stores.  It also carries more of certain items like prepared foods, sushi, wine, candy by the pound, and bakery than the Giant Eagles closer to Cleveland - I'm guessing this is due to its location in a more affluent suburb where people are more likely to spend on these products.  It also has more floor space devoted to seasonal items such as local sports memorabilia and (at Christmas time) Christmas ornaments, so I have found some interesting things to buy other than food here. 

On the minus side, the store layout is not very user-friendly.  Upon entering the store you have to navigate the large bakery, prepared food, wine and seasonal sections before you even get to the food.  I realize this is to encourage you to spend on these items but if you go in specifically to get a can of beans or a package of meat, it's a pain having to walk about a half mile just to get to standard food items.  The food aisles also don't go all the way through the store front to back.  Instead the aisle is divided in half by another aisle and different products are placed on the two halves of the aisle.  This has made it very hard for me to find things several times.   The store also seems to have way too much useless junk for sale, such as cheap children's toys and books.  Finally, this store always seems to have uniformed security guards hanging around prominently, making me wonder what is going on at this location to make that necessary, as I go to several Giant Eagles located closer to Cleveland and do not see this kind of ""security presence"" at any of them unless the police have been specifically called to deal with some incident.  Since Westlake does not seem like a high crime area (in fact the opposite) I have to wonder why 1-2 uniformed security men are needed at this particular store.","5kCRty4p7tBwM9P7MAXgvA",3,"2014-05-04",0,"review",0

I like the quirky little barrels for tables and such like.

My poor friend and I had been in a cheap little bar on the Cowgate where it was a pound a drink (my round, score!). Then we came in here and it was his round, unlucky for him. Vodka and coke and JD and coke came to just over £6. Poor guy was in shock! So a little expensive. But its quite fun and it has a good atmosphere with friendly bar staff.

This entry road alone conjures up a spectacular atmosphere - it's almost like the movies where the best clubs are down some shady side street.  This street itself is perfectly safe, but it does do its job in creating a fabulous mood - all it lacks is a haze of mist for you to navigate through on your way to the door.

Once inside the first thing you'll notice is a vast amount of sporting memorabilia - mostly Irish with a few exception such as a Sunderland shirt above the bar - perhaps donated by Anthony Stokes, but who knows how this shirt came to end up in this collection.  Thanks to its location this pub has managed to maintain a high proportion of Irish patrons and the atmosphere remains distinctly Irish.

They have a good set up, with lots of open space, some huge booths and a stage at the far end. The interior is under George IV bridge so has a cool underground feel to it. As well as this they always have good bands on, nothing too original, all kinda Irishy / Folk / Rock covers but they are good fun, either to chill out to and have a chat, or to have a shimmy when it gets a bit more upbeat. Make sure to get there early (about half 12 / 1ish) because although it is pretty dead then, it gets full unbelievably quickly.

From an Irish bar you expect slightly overpriced drinks, Dropkicks is really bad. Expect to pay almost £4 a pint, and they are pretty average, including the Guinness which is not as good as you'd expect. Spirits and mixers are pricey too, and whilst I haven't had the wine, I would be surprised if that bucked the trend. 

Apart from that it's a good place to go for a night out, or after other bars have kicked out (it's open until 3) especially if you fancy a bit of live music.","5VZFneSINtbXhxPPiedXyA",4,"2010-08-07",0,"review",0

There are often live bands playing at the weekend as well, which is good craic.  

Everyone that comes here is always up for fun times and there's not a hint of pretentiousness about it, so you can make very little effort with your appearance, and no one will really care. But that could be because they've had too much Guinness and aren't able to distinguish who their friends are, let alone whether some random person has bothered to put mascara on or not.

What haunts me whenever I come here is Dropkick Murphy's previous life as a bar/club called Berties.

As you would expect the walls are covered in Irish icons; rugby shirts, road signs and Guinness adverts and the staff are largely Irish. It has a small dance floor, however Dropkick's is not a night-club. It is spacious, with most of the room taken up by 4 or 5 large booths with a big table and seats. Since these are large tables it is common to share them with other patrons, which depending on your view of meeting people, can be a curse or a blessing. 
The drinks are typically priced for the centre of Edinburgh, with a pint of lager costing around £3. However, the main advantage to Dropkick's is that you can still be served up until around 3am, which means that if you are kicked out of another bar and do not feel ready for bed, or in the mood for a club, you can still have a drink in Dropkick's. In saying that, the music can sometimes be too loud for a conversation with anyone but the person sitting next to you. Also, on the weekend there is a door charge of around £2 after 11 or 12pm.

As I said, it's heaving.  It's like, impossible to walk across the room without getting shoved, stepped on, spilled on, heaving.  Want to buy a pint?  Forget it.

That was 5 years ago. This place really isn't my 'scene' any more. But I am trying to be unbiased and give it a fair review for what it is. A large venue, with live music, friendly staff, reasonable rates to get in on a Saturday night (£3 I think), and a decent crowd.

It's rough around the edges, definitely not glam (I'm not really that either...I'm just very indecisive!), and if they had a particular band playing here I wanted to see it'd be an alright music venue. It just feels a little 'old' and staid and not as fresh or funky as I like it (yes I just used the word funky and realise how ironic that is when used in the same sentence as 'fresh'.)

I also admit that I ended up here after several cocktails and a bottle of wine. So my memory is a *leetle* hazy. Again, not a normal Saturday night venture for me any more. But the staff were friendly which is always a plus. And it has that cool 'hidden under a bridge' thing going for it.

I'm not considering this a full review, since we just stopped in here for dessert and coffee.  I'll have to come back for an actual MEAL, and do more of a review then.

3 of us ordered desserts (2 slices of cake, one of the apple pie).  Received ginormous portions (especially of the cake, 3 of us could split one slice of that).  Everything was tasty, but not made on-premises (I actually think I saw packaging from Sam's in the dessert case on the way out).  Decent value for the money.  This area doesn't have many options if you've got the taste for dessert (other than ice cream) and don't want to whip up some brownies.

Food I saw on other tables all looked pretty good.  Pleasant server, decent ""diner-style"" ambiance.  Pretty extensive menu, especially for breakfast.  Spotless bathroom.

He was in clear view and in the way of the service traffic. Nobody that worked there said a word to this oaf as he chowed down! We just looked at each other and laughed in disbelieve! Good thing we don't use ketchup on our eggs! The funniest thing was after we got our food the the tide of people that came in behind us must have overwhelmed them!

After reviewing the menu I decided to try something 'safe' so I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The meat loaf had very little seasoning, if any.  It had an odd taste.  It also appeared to be overcooked around the edges.  There was quite a 'crust' on it.  Overall, not appetizing at all.  The 'mashed' potatoes were quite lumpy.  I had to finish mashing them with the fork.  It appeared they had been mashed quickly, possibly just before they were served.  Again, lack of seasoning, particularly salt.  Not good at all.   I didn't finish either item.

And when I tried to pay my check, there was no one at the register.  I probably stood there about 3 minutes before another customer got in line behind me.  She finally summoned a waiter and asked if we could pay our bills.  The response was, ""I don't know where she is.""  He then disappeared for a moment and then returned and said ""She will be with you in a minute.""   Not good customer service.

The whole meal was not very good.  While the price was reasonable, the food didn't live up to the hype that I received.  I don't think I would either recommend this place or go there again.  There are better places with food that is more appetizing.   A real disappointment for sure.","2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w",2,"2015-02-26",0,"review",0

The Chicken Noodle Soup looked like glorified boxed soup.  The salad had lettuce that was starting to rust.  Someone must really like onions because there were 7 large slices of red onion on it.  But, here is the best part was the dressing came in a squeeze package like the ones at fast food places.  The meatloaf was horrible but strangely the mashed potatoes were good.  The fried chicken was OK. They make it with honey so chicken is very sweet and not something I'd eat again.  The fries were typical frozen french fries but were OK.  

If the food wasn't disappointing enough, all of the servers had bad attitudes and it showed.  We could hear all the talk from the kitchen since we were so close.  It is obvious no one wants to be there.  They don't care about the quality of their food or service. Now we know why the parking lot was almost empty on a Friday night.

I have been going here for years and there have been a lot of different employees over the last 10 years. I have never had a bad customer experience at this location though. The staff is always very friendly. Especially for some of the people they put up with on a daily basis since this place isn't in the best area. 

I do highly recommend this place for the pizza by the slice if you aren't too uppity to visit a store in a low income area. There are some sketchy looking characters around sometimes but nobody has ever bothered me in the 10 years I've been going there.

The kitchen serves up hot, made to order pizzas (also available by the slice), subs, fried chicken, and jojos at very reasonable prices!  Fellow Yelper, Darren R has been raving about the delicious Fiery Gauntlet sub for a while and he has reason to because that sammich and the Italian sub I've tried have been really tasty!  They come loaded with savory deli meat and cheese sliced fresh in house with fresh, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion finished with a smidgen of creamy Italian dressing, nicely toasted on a seasoned hoagie roll...all for around $4-$5.49.  
I've had the pizza by the slice and it's pretty good at $1.69 for one slice or $2.99 for two slices!  You can order a whole pizza any way you'd like it too.

All it took was the words ""Churrasqueira"" on the sign to convince me to step inside and abandon my plans of going to the gym. I'd never heard of a Churrasqueira before, but it sounded kinda like ""Carniceria,"" which always means good food.

I parked my bike in front of a be-toqued hobo and crossed the threshold. This place is the real deal. Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine. A baba-from-the-old-country-looking lady sat in a corner, monologuing to a group men standing around in jackets and scarves. Everyone seemed like they belonged here, like they either worked for the place or were related to someone who did. Some hilarious over-the-top foreign soap opera played in the corner, unwatched.

About the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old ""hi there, let me know if you have any questions!"" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen. I'd hoped I made a good first impression, because this girl became my rock. Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend.

Initially, I had planned to grab the food and go, but the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals. I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it; waitress girl brought out some bread and butter. Ahhhh yeaa, I was gonna make of night of this.

Before I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived. The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce. It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto.

The chicken was fantastic. Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices. It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on. The potatos, too, were remarkable: salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying. However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce. This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor. It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes.

All too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed. I felt truly good. Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit. I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome. I think the waitress even called me cute at the end there. Ahh yeaa.","2H5EaBEreDzzP7sPmD_oDQ",5,"2015-03-10",0,"review",0

Tasty and good value?  Definitely!

This completely unassuming super authentic Portuguese place is located in currently trendifying and hipsterfying part of Dundas West between Bathurst and Ossington.  Decor is minimal with a TV.  Expect to see lots of Portuguese families in this casual, casual joint.

The FOOD was all decent with some hits and misses.  The grouper was quite tasty, although we weren't sure that it was actually grouper.  The half chicken was probably the best dish of the night and came with a delightfully spicy dipping sauce.  The steak, which I ordered medium rare,  was served on the well done side of well done; however, the flavor was actually good.  I don't get why places ask about steak temperatures if it's not going to make a difference anyway.  Fries were pretty limp.

SERVICE was friendly and very casual.  Definitely not a place to come if you're in a rush.  The food took a long time to come out, but the free bread and olives helped with the wait.  

OVERALL. the VALUE is good.  Most of the entrees are in the $8-$13 range.  Drinks are fairly reasonable as well.  It doesn't quite rate as a hidden gem, but I'll call it a hidden cubic zirconium.","2H5EaBEreDzzP7sPmD_oDQ",3,"2014-10-01",0,"review",0

Since we could put my son in swimming lessons there for no extra cost, we just went there. However, my son has a bit of apprehension in the water. He gained some skills in their lessons, but he was stagnating over time.

We've known a few people who enrolled their children at Making Waves, and one thing I knew right off the bat that would make them ideal is the max of 3-1 child to teacher ratio. I can't emphasize enough how important that is, as I watched my son at his previous lessons have to wait several minutes at a time for his turn when there were about 5 in his class.

From what I've seen, the instruction is also at a high level. One example is previously my son was learning to float by having the teacher hold him under his shoulders and pull them along the water. Here, the teacher actually helps support him more under his lower body. It makes sense, as the upper body is where the body floats, with the lower body being prone to sink being only muscle and bone. This technique seems to give the student a better sense of learning how and then trusting their body to float. They also do a great job of helping push students just outside of their comfort zone. Enough to encourage learning, but not enough to scare them too much. For example, for some of the lessons you'll see the teachers count loudly to 5 as the student is doing their best to stay afloat when swimming,which seems seems a reasonable amount of time for them to push through, without worrying about being under too long.

Terrific facility as well, with a huge viewing area to watch the lessons, a play area for kids who may be waiting, and a nice change area. A terrific thing about this place is that they use salt water as a natural cleanser/disinfectant for the pool rather than chlorine. It improves the smell, but I'm sure it's better for skin too.

It is naturally more costly to attend here than most other places. I can't fault them for that given the details above; but I wish they'd offer the 10% discount for the second child rather than only if you have 3 attending. Many don't have 3 kids to begin with, and I think a 10% is still a fair deal if family have 2 children attending given the cost.

It is what it is, but ultimately, everything is at a high standard. One month of lessons in, my son has progressed at a rate that may have taken 6 elsewhere.","7OMesO90cUTBCA9eoemYQw",5,"2016-06-13",0,"review",2

Mir wäre bisher auch kein Steakhouse bekannt, das dem MonTero kulinarisch auch nur annähernd das Wasser reichen könnte! Das ist argentinische Küche auf Höchstniveau!

Wie wir bedauerlicherweise erfahren haben, hat der Verpächter den Vertrag mit dem MonTero nicht mehr verlängert, nachdem sich dessen Betreiber zu Recht geweigert haben, ihr Konzept der argentinischen Küche über den Haufen zu werfen, um ab sofort nur noch einfache schwäbische Hausmannskost (Schnitzel und Maultaschen) anzubieten. Argentinische Küche auf Höchstniveau, präsentiert in wunderschönem, stilvollem Ambiente, scheint nicht im Interesse des Verpächters gewesen zu sein, dieser will dort angeblich wieder eine schäbige Clubgaststätte auf einfachstem schwäbischen Niveau eröffnen.

 Erstaunlich, was man aus der Sportlerkneipe des TSV Birkach zaubern konnte! Schöne Steakhaus-Atmosphäre, gemütlich dunkel (Lederstühle, dunkle Tische, z. T. Täfelung), aber dennoch modern, fast ein wenig stylish!


 Service tadellos, zuvorkommend, freundlich. Wir haben sogar einen Schnaps auf Kosten des Hauses bekommen.


 Und das Essen: Sehr gutes Fleisch von südamerikanischen Rindern, genau richtig gegrillt. Dazu leckere Kartoffelecken. Auch der Baked Potato am Nebentisch sah gut aus, ebenso der gemischte Salat und der Beilagenspinat. Und das Erstaunliche: sehr humane Preise (z. B. 180 gr-Steak für 11 EUR). Außerdem auf der Speisekarte: Fisch und Meeresgetier, Vegetarisches, sogar Maultaschen und ein paar weitere schwäbische Zugeständnisse.


 Große Sonnenterrasse, schöner Spielplatz für Kinder, ausreichend Parkplätze vor dem Haus. Sogar eine Kegelbahn gibt es. Für Gruppen lässt sich ein Teil des Restaurants abteilen.


 Absolut empfehlenswert!

Es liegt am Rande des Stadtteils direkt an Wald und Wiesen des Ramsbachtals. Gestern (29.3.10) entschloss ich mich sponatan mit Begleitung das Restaurant aufzusuchen. Es liegt nur ca. 20 Gehminuten von S-Hoffeld entfernt. Das Gebäude gehört wohl irgendwie zum TSV Birkach der dort diverse Sport-stätten betreibt. Vermutlich war es mal die Vereinsgastätte. Überbleibsel finden sich in der teilweise übernommenen Inneneinrichtung wieder u.a. (hellbraune Holztische) 
Es gibt einen Tresen und ausreichende Sitzmöglichkeiten die den heutigen An-sprüchen angepasst wurden. Trotz allem blitzt das Sportlerheimambiente durch, dem sollte sich jeder Besucher bewusst sein. Zum Essen: Das Angebot (bis 1.4.10 nur Mo/Di/Do) versprach 200g frisches Filet-Steak mit Beilagensalat für 15 EUR pro Person ! Der (gemischte) Salat wurde vorab auf einem kleinen Teller mit Dressing serviert. 
Er überzeugte durch seine Frische, kein Billigkraut aus dem 10-Liter-Eimer, bis auf die Gurkenscheiben, die wohl schon länger aufgeschnitten rumlagen. Das Steak wurde kurz drauf aufgetischt. Garniert mit einem großen Salatblatt, ein kleines Stück Kräuterbutter und Danke der Küche eine Portion Kartoffelecken ;-) Das Steak war nicht ganz nach meinem Wunsch gebraten, was ich aber nicht reklamierte. Es war sehr schmackhaft, zart innen und aussen lecker kroß angebraten. Wirklich sehr gute Qualität. Fazit: Gutes Essen zu angemessenem Preis, sehr freundliche und nicht aufdringliche Bedienung.

Fast forward to today - I now really enjoy shopping at Sobey's.  As a parent of little ones, I'm so grateful that they have this Free Fresh Fruit for Kids deal near the front entrance, by the produce.  Shopping for groceries is one of the dullest things to put a young kid through, and this treat they offer to all kids (12 and under) is a joy in keeping both myself, the kids, and fellow shoppers, happy.

The prices, in general, are fair.  Sale prices can be good!  (Love their deals on almond milk, sometimes 2 cartons for $7; or Haagen Daaz for $4.99).   Freshness is similar to what you'd expect to find.

Air Miles collectors will appreciate earning 1 point for every $20 spent.

Spending $40 or more will currently get you a receipt offering .04 cents off a litre of gas at a Shell gas station, although there's a gas station with competitively priced gas (we're talking about savings similar to that at Costco's).

We come here with our dog, put him near the large front windows, where I can shoot a glance his way as I shop.  There is a lovely woman who works within this Sobey's.  She is a true dog person with a gold heart.  I've seen her come out to say Hi to our little guy more than once.  Met her by first name today.  I love seeing this genuine, caring side in people.

There was another time where the person who was restocking on some Haagen Daaz ice cream, opened a new case of ice cream, just to provide me with a very frozen container.  It wasn't easy to get to.  This gesture was appreciated.

I'm finding that people who work here are just lovely, real people.  Nice people.

Funny how they have products that link up to famous chefs, like Jamie Oliver, and a few others (see their pesto, pasta sauce, and frozen food sections) to other chefs that are famous but that I can't think of by name right now.

Nothing like Frost in Tucson, although they do carry the flavor Striciatella. The chocolate with hazelnut was okay, except there were hardly any hazelnuts in it. The chocolate was okay too but there were no chocolate shavings in it either....It tastes more like regular ice cream than gelato, so don't know if I care for it that much. The place is hip and cool though. The scoops are way small than Frost size servings. The owner was there and apparently they make all their stuff right on site. I asked her if she had yogurt too and she said that sometimes they make it but its so hard to make so she tends to be lazy on that part. Nice people though.

There are over 30 flavors to choose from, and multiple flavors can be added into the same cup!  This place is extremely generous with the syrup quantity too.  Feel free to save the, ""We want more!  We want more!"" in this case!  
Most of the flavors are on the sweet side, so if you're not a fan I suggest grabbing a sugar free flavor or a sour flavor (the word sour will be in the name).

Don't forget to add the ice cream!  The only flavor offered is vanilla, but it is delicious and compliments most flavors (sour flavors not so much)!  The ice cream is very smooth and creamy.  

By the way, this little shack is located in a gas station's parking lot.  If you're planning to drive away immediately after receiving your order, I suggest asking for your choice of size served in a bigger cup.  For example, I normally have my medium serving placed in the cup meant for a large serving.  The cups normally have 2-3 inches of shaved ice stacked above the rim, so this is a good option for busy-bodies like myself.

One last note, the staff definitely deserves recognition.  Every worker that I've come across during my visits is always wearing a smile and has a goofy personality that can make anyone smile.  That can't be easy after being cooped up for hours!  Much appreciated!  Will definitely keep coming back!","0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug",4,"2015-07-19",1,"review",1

Love the flavor choices and you can put ice cream in your cup along with your snowcone but the contrasting smooth ice cream and hard crunchy ice didn't work for me. (Tried to mix vanilla and their root beer for a root beer float and it didn't work)

2nd time through I just had root beer and it was delicious . 

The daughter has only had Blue Rasberry and while she won't ever share with me I can speak to her Smurf blue lips and tounge when she finishes.

The only down side to the place is that they don't have ample parking or a bench to sit and eat your treats. I can trust my teenager enough not to get syrup all over the leather in my car but if you have young kids they will either be running around a parking lot amped up on Sugar or sitting in your vehicle making everything sticky.

My mom, 2-year-old, and I dropped into John's on a Wednesday at 10:30. I was pleased at how quiet and drowsy it was inside, yet we still got greeted enthusiastically and the waitress tended to us right away. Something tells me that if we were to come in at the same time on a Saturday, it would have been packed, but we would have still been acknowledged and served in an efficient manner. It's just that type of place and seems to be run really smoothly.

Two things I was surprised about: their corned beef hash is, like, REAL. No crap out of a can (though I will always hold a special place in my heart for that salty gruel). It tasted great and came out fast. The second thing: they have a sign on the table boasting their own root beer made with cane sugar. I hate root beer, but that's pretty impressive.

 My daughter had a short stack of blueberry hotcakes and we had more than half left over because they were huge and hearty. My mom requested that her omelette be made with egg whites only, and they did that with no problem. 

The coffee wasn't AMAZING, but it was better than average, hot, and the refills kept coming. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive.

My friend says their pancakes are the best she's ever had. I've never had them as I'm not much of a pancake eater, but she's a connoisseur so I'll take her word for it. As for cleanliness - I've definitely eaten in cleaner joints. I've never been in the bathroom, not even sure if they have one. Also, I wouldn't look at the floor if I were you...

The reason John's gets 4 and not 3, is they have what I call a great 'diner waitress'. A great diner waitress is somebody who is very efficient, never misses anything, and always keeps your coffee hot. She calls you 'hun' or 'sweetie' but it somehow isn't patronizing like it is when other people say it. Don't know her name and she's very young but she is great and is always there.

Too many restaurants slink around your ankles like beaten dogs, cravenly asking, ""Do you want anything, sir?  Please?  Yes, I can get it for you, restaurant-Gollum loves the master, we adoreses you...""

John's Diner will serve you, but on its own terms.  They treat you like people; they're happy to see you, but they've been around for fifty years and will be around for fifty more.  The waitresses tell you what's going on in the back, complain merrily about the job, bring your food to you, pat you on the shoulders.  They have that quiet pride that says, ""If you behave well, you're part of the family here.  If not, here's the door.""  I didn't ask for anything special, but one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, ""Now, what did you want THAT for?""

As such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere.  This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter.  

The food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon, but that's actually part of the charm; they don't care about eating healthy, they want you to eat hearty.  They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional but it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget.

Would I recommend this to my snooty foodie friends?  No.  But would I take them here the morning after a night out for comfort food?  You betcha.  Would I go here myself when I'm tired of exotic foods and just want a damn sandwich?

It is also the weirdest dining experience I have experienced in all my years...

So I've driven by quite a few times and it struck me as a place the locals go when they've had one too many or maybe a place some of the locals frequent for a weekend hangover cure. 

To preface this, I'm under the impression that things were going through a change on this first and last visit here. There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the ""chef"" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well. 

So, anyhow, the story:
Two adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal. 

Let's order!

So the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles. 

Each meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. 

The soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they ""of the dayified"" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.

Spaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. 

The roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.

While that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the ""chef"" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the ""sauce"" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. 

The ""chef"" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it ""Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles""!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. 

I sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. 

The waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. 

She asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). 
So we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......
So I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery. Losing it to say the least. I felt bad at first but then she started to smack the register each time a button press was unsuccessful....kinda in a way when you first find out your girl is a little bit kinky but you aren't quite sure what that means.","-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ",1,"2014-05-20",2,"review",1

The third time, however, wasn't the best experience. The service was prompt, friendly as ever. The food was exceptional. The omlettes were 5 bucks and came with toast. We both added hash browns for $1.25. I got coffee and orange juice. He got lemonade and $2 stuffed grape leaves (which were the worst we've ever had.) They were different, not sour, didn't taste fresh at all. Anyways, we've always loved the exceptionally low prices, especially for the quality of food here.

 My experience is very similar to all those who have already posted here do your self a favour and buy elsewhere. 
I ordered a baby carrier online, made the payment (which was accepted without any problem) received a confirmation email noting that they were out of stock but would be able to post the goods at the end of next month (ie 30+ days later!)


 I promptly replied (via email) requesting a refund, I received no reply. I called the number on the website the next day and the call went straight to voice mail (the v/m didn't even announce ANY company name, just a machine tone then silence) I wrote another email made several more attempts to phone them then searched the web for reviews/ratings of this company. To my dismay I found this site and one other with similar correspondence.


 What I did
-I threatened to contact the Edinburg trading standards. 
-Contact the bank and request they charge back the transaction.
-Call my brother in-law who (luckily for me) lived literally just down the road from Aktive8/EH3 9AN.


 Result : 1 week after the initial order & payment I received four replies, apologies and a confirmation that a refund has been made back into my account.

 Aktive8 are an online Outdoor Gear & Leisure store based in Edinburgh with only a few staff (source: corporate192.com). I just thought I'd mention my recent experience with using Aktive8. If you decide to buy from Aktive8 be warned should anything go wrong and you need to return a faulty product, expect potential trouble.


 Active8 seem to be only interested in taking money and not providing any quality support or customer service.


 Ordering was fine but the product was faulty. Returned following instructions on website. The level of response I received was in stark contrast to that suggested in the Warranties section of the Aktive8 website.


 Nearly four months later I had still not received a refund or replacement. I eventually received a refund, without an apology or explanation of the delay.


 Aktive8 has a telephone number (premium rate) that only answered by a recorded message stating 'all lines are busy'. If you call at midnight on Sunday you'll hear the same message. If you call on one phone and get the message, then call on another simultaneously, the second phone gets an engaged tone.


 Emails are read, but not responded to. I did receive a single email stating that 'there has been a delay'. No apology or explanation of why.


 Appalling customer services. I would AVOID at all costs. I'd personally recommend http://www.wiggle.co.uk - they have a tried and tested reputation and offer discounts too.


 It appears I'm not alone in this either. If you read the reviews at
http://www.reviewcentre.com/reviews173957.html 


 If you need to contact Aktive8 don't use the costly 0871 231 8888 number it has the recorded all lines are busy message, so does 0131 228 5047. Use the shop number on 0131 228 3003.

I emailed this company from Austin and immediately got a call back from Justin, which was promising.  We arranged the time and he assured me he would be there at 11am sharp with his crew.  I had the entire trip planned out in great detail since I had less than 18 hours to get everything done in time and had to get my grandfather to the airport to fly back with him.

I contacted Jennifer requesting package info and price quotes for hair and make up 1.5 weeks prior to my engagement photo session. She replied within 12 hours with a friendly email explaining what she had to offer. After reading an offer I couldn't refuse, I called her to ask any remaining questions, which she gladly answered and decided to ask her to send me a contract, which was sent promptly via email. She requested that I email her with my ideas of what ""look"" I wanted to achieve for my photos. She said that I could email/text her pictures of my ideas and what I like. She also asked me to send a picture of myself so that she could ensure she'd have the right colors to match my skin tone. Once I emailed her with photos and information on what I wanted, she provided me with advice on how to prep myself for the day of the shoot.

 She gladly offered to come out to conduct our appointment at the hotel we were staying at on the strip. She arrived early...EARLY - about 6:45 AM for our 7 AM appointment. She set up in our bathroom and we got to work. She did mermaid curls for me and did airbrush makeup. She informed me that the makeup might look a bit heavier than what I had requested, as photo shoot make up needs to be a bit heavier. She ensured me that the right look would still come out in the photos. She was spot-on right. I did think the make-up looked heavy in person, but when I received my photos from the photographer, the make-up could not have been more perfect! Had it been any lighter, I may have been disappointed. I could not be any happier with the look that she helped me to achieve. It was very natural, but heavy enough so that my features would come out in the pictures. My curls stayed intact beyond our session, so I was able to have fun with them while walking around in Vegas.

 I cannot recommend Jennifer enough. She is experienced, friendly, and affordable. Please book her and trust her for your big day!","7QCi9ON3nRx6W8htg2ck-A",5,"2013-10-27",0,"review",0

I had contracted their services almost a year ago for wedding hair and makeup.  At that point they had rave reviews on wedding wire and yelp.  However, things have taken a turn for the worst in 2014 by the company, as evidenced by the other reviews on this site.  Even from the get go, I had difficulty receiving an email with the contract.  Jennifer, the owner, attributed the delay the first time to problems with the email: info@museartistrylv.com.  Eventually, we sorted that out.  Email problems happen, so I figure no big deal.  Fast forward to my engagement hair and makeup, that went off without a hitch.  So there are the two stars from my experience from August 2013 (see my other review).  So fast forward, I'm a little over a month out from my wedding. I schedule my trial hair and makeup way in advance and even send an email confirming time and date.  My trial time is 11am...I just happen to check my email while waiting for them to show up for the trial.  In my inbox is an email, sent that morning, canceling for the day since one of the artists is ill. Okay, illness happens but as a professional company and owner you need to pick up the phone and call your client. An email is not an acceptable form of cancellation. So I pick up my phone and call to see if I can reschedule, no answer on her personal cell or the company phone number.  The best part is the voicemail that states leave your info and we will get back to you in 24 hours.  I also email both emails again asking for someone to call me regarding rescheduling.  Yeah...don't count on a response in 24 hours. Fast forward 4 days later, I again send another email and leave voicemails on both numbers requesting contact.  I decide at this point to send a text message with something along the lines of please let me know if I need to start looking elsewhere for hair and makeup services.  I finally get a text message stating that her phone had died and that she would make my next appointment a priority.  Okay, I get your phone died but you clearly still have access to email since you sent me one to cancel the morning of the trial.... I follow up by asking who the artists will be for the trial, it ended up not being the same two listed on my contract.  She did sound sincere, as sincere as you can be on text message regarding the cancellation.  But after I reviewed all my email correspondence with her, this is the second time she has had problems with her iPhone.  She may indeed have very poor luck with her phone....might I suggest a land line or one not routed to your cell phone. But at this point, I had a decision to make....do I worry about being stood up on my wedding day via email or do I find peace of mind and cancel. The choice was easy, I'll consider my deposit a donation and move on.  However, I did the responsible thing in this break up.  I did try to call to cancel, but surprise no one picked up.  I also emailed and texted just to be on the safe side.  She did respond to the text.  I will tell you that IF they show up you will probably get good value for services rendered, since I shopped around and they were the lowest priced packages.  But you know lesson learned, you get what you pay for...  Brides, make an educated decision.","7QCi9ON3nRx6W8htg2ck-A",2,"2014-03-13",6,"review",1

It would have been about two months ago, I used to live a stone's throw away from this location and whenever I was feeling particularly lazy, or lax about spending money I would shop here.  Employees were always friendly and whenever I needed a quick feta fix or a last minute bit of cilantro for for finishing my revered spicy Thai peanut sauce this was my spot.

So as I was saying before my ramble, I experienced the ultimate in ""feel good"" moments here a few short months back.  I was picking up some produce and must have been shaking my head visibly at the astronomical cost of everything, when I was approached by an aisle clerk who covertly pointed me in the direction of what appeared to be a shopping cart set aside.  I thought that my eyes had deceived me. This cart was brimming with produce!  Many of the items I had in my hands were in said cart and I was informed that they would be throwing them away, but that if I wanted they may be able to sell to me at a marked discount.  I jumped at this opportunity and was actually able to buy three times what I needed at half the price.  I made a vegetable heavy pasta salad, cous cous, and vegetable noodle soup, and was super happy that I was allowed to find a home for these soon to be discarded items.  Definitely a feel good moment for both my wallet and soul.

I don't know if this act of charitable kindness was against store policy, and hope that I'm not getting someone who committed an admirable act in trouble with management, but something like this should be commended and not condemned.  This one gesture more than made up for all the over- priced items that I have bought at Sobey's over the years.

Sorry to be so open but i get brazillians and this place SUCKS. when i started i was kinda shopping around trying to find a place i liked and someone that made me comfortable. The first time i did it was at this place and i did not like it. I didnt do it again for a while until i found Donato's and found my lady. the only other 2 times i have gone here was because my lady was gone and this place was easy and convenient. After the last time I will NEVER EVER GO AGAIN. first off, if your an esthetician you should look like you take car of yourself because you are promoting your work. Its like going to a hair dresser and her hair is a nest of mess....would you want her to cut your hair? NOPE. Anyways this girl just was overly tanned with avatar make up and looked like she didnt take care of herself at all. this kind of put me off but i just figured whatever i will go with it. the room they put you in is cramped and is not very warm or comforting. You kinda feel like your in a box. The girl started doing her thing but she was horrible. she was not gentle (and believe me you can be gently during this process) and the wax was too hot. I had burns and bruises it was not fun. She layed wax over the same spots twice or three times to get 1 hair she could have plucked out. ANYONE who gets waxed from a professional knows you CAN NOT put hot wax over the same spot twice...it causes burns. I also used to work in a spa so i know these things. She was just not friendly to me at all and was so rough with me. I did not like this at all. But you get what you pay for, its cheap for a reason i guess. 

In a situation like that i like being comfortable and relaxed and i was not. I wouldn't suggest anyone go here if you consider your body a temple.

We took the ""Sensation"" tour; it was a 3-hour boat cruise up Loch Ness with a stop at Urquhart Castle and then a bus ride back to town.  The boat ride itself was fun -- a few hours in we were treated to an impromptu whiskey tasting (yeah, try downing 3 reserve's and a single malt before touring around the castle....) by one of the Chivas Regal distributors, which was an excellent surprise.  

If you're a student, the bonuses get even better as they offer a decent discount.

I am a regular customer at Kashman's and although I feel like it's kind of expensive, I love their food, so it's worth it to me!  Today I had the chopped farmers salad (no cheese + turkey).  I love that it is full with veggies and the light balsamic dressing they use goes perfectly with it!  

Other menu items that I order consistently are the omelettes (they do egg whites no problem), oatmeal, trifecta plate, turkey sandwich, and tuna melt.  The bagels are the best I've had in Arizona, and my friend DeDe swears by their matzah ball soup!

I witnessed an interesting scenario when I was there today... a guy had bought lunch for his wife and came up to the register when I was paying and said: ""Excuse me... my wife changed her mind and does not like her cookie and she wants to exchange it for a blueberry muffin.""  

Nancy, the owner, looked at him and apologetically said ""I'm sorry, sir - that is the cookie she chose and I cannot serve that cookie to anyone else now.  You can buy a blueberry muffin if you'd like.""

This made me think two things: 1 - I'm glad they will not reserve food like that but 2 - perhaps they should have asked if the cookie was bad, etc... and maybe even done so much as to give them a muffin to make them happy?

Sign me up...

Three of us went for lunch and got sandwiches. My cousin, a 19-year-old macho man terrorizing much of the Phoenix female population currently, got the chicken salad sandwich. He liked it a lot. It was piled high with mayonnaisy (how in the heck should I spell that, sorry) looking chopped chicken. My boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich with cheese and roasted red peppers. He thought it was pretty good, but picked off the red peppers. I tried one, and could see why they wouldn't really fit with the rest -- really pungent tasting, would totally overwhelm and stand out from the other flavors. I got the half sandwich/half salad combo with the thanksgiving turkey sandwich (cranberry spread, yum) on whole wheat, house salad. Eh, just ok. Nothing special. 

This rates ok since it's convenient and serviceable, but really it's not the good Jewish deli I was hoping for, and the prices are pretty high for just a sandwich.

We became intimately familiar with it when we lived for nearly a year up in a  Grayhawk apartment, waiting for our condo renovation to be completed.  I love the egg dishes (try the Chicago omelet), the salads (Trifecta rocks), pastries made in-store (the black-and-whites are good, and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated, though, so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving) and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness (contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out).  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the owner's family to be quite friendly and quick to recognize regulars.

Seating is sketchy during peak hours, although, for a relatively small strip-center establishment, there are a decent number of tables in and outside.  As a first-timer, remember to ask the wait staff at the door to give you a number corresponding with an open table.  You will need this when placing your order at the counter.

We each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast.  There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk.  Coffee was good.  After a few minutes the food was served to us.  My french toast (stuffed w/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious.  It was one of the dishes where I have to tell my wife that if she wants a bite she better hurry up and get it while there is some to be had.  I finished the whole thing, no problem and wish the serving size had been a touch bigger.  The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it.  There was much honeydew and cantaloupe (both of which I dislike) and precious few slices of delicious strawberry.

I've placed orders and by the time I reach the cashier she's forgotten it and I am often asked ""Which order was yours?"".  A few months ago I pulled in around 8am on a Sunday.  I was the only car in the drive thru but no one would answer the speaker.  Finally I drove around and went in to order.  I saw all of the employees standing in the back laughing and joking, no one was up at the counter.  When the counter employee finally saw me, she gave a huge sigh and acted like I was bothering her by being there.

I have occasionally gone there around 4-5am and am not surprised to be waiting up to ten minutes for food.  No, that's not an exaggeration, I timed it at a few seconds over 10 minutes last trip (with only two cars ahead of me).  I know it's a McD's and I'm not expecting a five star dining experience but the wait times can get ridiculous.

As far as the food goes, I haven't had an awful experiences.  They usually get my order right and the food is what you'd expect at a McD's, you're just going to wait an awful long time for it.","42rDLL6vNJ5w66Ccj6a5XQ",1,"2014-01-27",0,"review",0

The bistro is attached to an art gallery that features art and handcrafted pieces from local artists.

My friend was interested in trying this place because of the fried green tomato BLT and she said that it did not disappoint! 

I ordered the turkey pita wrap with black eyed pea hummus (that I requested on the side) asiago french fries with a cucumber rittiata (sp?) dipping sauce.  My meal was delicious! In fact, I have been thinking about it all day.  

All of the ingredients were fresh and extremely flavorful.  The hummus tasted like they had just prepared it as I ordered (and not took it out of a pre-made package).  The only gripe I had was that my turkey pita was served in a tortilla NOT a pita.

For beverages, we both ordered the White Peach Iced Tea and it was very refreshing.

I found the prices to be quite reasonable, not at all extravagant.  The price of my turkey wrap was $8.50 and the drink was $2.50. About the same as you would pay at any mid-level chain restaurant.

I look forward to coming back and trying the fried green BLT and just about everything else on the menu.

The spicy mustard took over the sandwich and kind of killed my tastebuds a bit.  My dining partners had an omelet and gumbo (reviewed favorably), the fried green tomato BLT (which disappeared off the plate quickly enough to indicate its deliciousness) and the ""Birkdale Breakfast"" (which was on par, but not fantastic).

On two occasions, they have been unable to make martinis because they were out of alcohol.  What?!  The fried chicken, while still tasty, has shrunk in portion size.  Their soups are ALWAYS so thick it's like eating sludge.  However, we still go back because some dishes are consistently good (like the filet mignon or the fried green tomato sandwich).

The lady waitresses were fantastic--they knew their stuff, and were kind and engaging.  The men of the house were awful in every sense: sassy, lazy, rude, bad servers and poor drink mixers. (When I pointed out that he had substituted 2 ingredients in a drink and was missing a third, he said ""yeah...we don't have the right stuff anymore.""  When I pointed to it on shelf behind him, he just walked away.)

We have gone twice in the past week, and both times the food was pretty blah.  It was oversalted (and I LOVE salt!), overcooked, and a lot of good ideas just missed the mark.  For example, the mac and cheese was insanely soggy, the fried chicken was dry and the french toast with apples had tough, unpeeled apples inside, and already had the syrup poured on top when it arrived at the table. Who does that?

I was excited to try this place after all the goods reviews, but after going twice and experiencing the same problems both times, I would say that they have either gotten lazy or had a change of staff.

Rather than the old-style mission look, it's a rectangular building, with a modern look on the inside.  It's actually a nice place.  The staff has always been friendly, and service is usually quick as well.  They even have some high stools around some tables that make for convenient quick meals, rather than the typical fast-food style seating.  It's nice and appealing.

Sweet Tea Report: What really sets this location apart is their sweet tea.  I don't know what it is, but this Taco Bell may have some of the best sweet tea out of any restaurant in Charlotte.  Definitely any fast food restaurant, but maybe any restaurant at all.  It's that good.  Unfortunately, you have to hit it right because depending on who makes it, the tea can be good or it can be bad.  Best of luck.

I know, all you haters of Taco Bell are crying about the chicken places that have good sweet tea, but trust me on this one.  Taco Bell - or at least this taco bell - has some dang good sweet tea.  Farmer's BBQ has some good Peach Sweeet Tea, but for regular old sweet tea, I'd put this stuff up against just about anyone (if you get a good batch).

And yes, I reviewed Taco Bell for #550.  How lame is that?","6nnI3DfHn-DTd6tWnZu7Jg",3,"2010-06-21",2,"review",1

It's kind of pointless having 2 sides to cook food on and you're only operating off of one with only one person working the line. Then on top of that because you're running one line with one person everything piles up and it takes forever to get your food when it should only take a few minutes at the most. Even better is the fact that they constantly mess up the orders over and over again. I mean sometimes I just want Taco Bell and sadly this is the closest one around my house unless I want to drive forever down the road. 

To top it off the sanitary in this place is horrible!! Constantly food all over the floor and your feet stick to it. Yet it never really looks like anyone cares to clean. Because of that I'm scared to even go into the bathrooms.

My friend and I were looking for lunch around 2 O'clock and stumbled upon Indian Flavour. It is right in the downtown core and hard to miss with it's huge red, vertical sign. It's a fun looking room with colourful drapes and attentive service for a buffet. 

Come lunchtime, the best option is the buffet for 10 dollars and change. For two people, they brought us one naan bread, cut in half which is a bit stingy if you ask me. Anywho, to the buffet! The salad selection is pretty miniscule. I didn't even try anything on it because they looked a bit left out. The onion baji and fried other thing were cold and didn't have the crunchiness that is so welcome in food like this. 

I applaud the order of the line-up of food. Apart from dessert towards the beginning, it is a very logical setup for putting together my plate. The food is ok at best. Butter chicken's chicken has hard, unappetizing chunks of fat on the meat with bones and the lamb curry's lamb is also very fatty in an oily sauce. We ordered more naan bread and were not charged. I liked the eggplant dish and the spinach though it could have had a lot more of the advertised cheese. The rest, and we tried a lot more, I don't really remember which is telling. Despite this, we still went for two rounds of food, learning from our mistakes and left feeling very full. Meh.","BOFvGNX-64B9Qzck1A-FOg",2,"2010-12-05",3,"review",2

Visiting on a late afternoon (about the same time I always used to frequent when I was at Ryerson), I found the large dining room almost completely empty. The once incredibly pleasant servers were now sitting around a table, discussing something that was more important than greeting me. 

Once we established that I was going to forgo the lunch buffet ($9.99) and just have a combo of two curries ($6.99) to go, I was walked over to the buffet spread and dished out my meal. Although there were a fair number of both meat and veg options to choose from, the curries mostly looked inspired. The saag that I chose was rather bland and had only one lonely cube of paneer in it. The butter sauce (sans chicken) was a much better balance of spicy and sweet. 

While the server was visibly displeased and inconvenienced by their running out of pre-made naan at the buffet table, it must have been my my lucky day since the freshly prepared naan was definitely worth the wait. Now if business could just go back to booming, perhaps Indian Flavour could manage to churn out consistently quality food again.","BOFvGNX-64B9Qzck1A-FOg",2,"2010-07-06",2,"review",0

Our hopes for the food were dashed.  Most of the selection at the buffet was uninspired.  Grease and salt were the prime ingredients as every dish was coated with oil and salty beyond belief.  It was so bad that I had to push myself to have a second plate, and didn't even bother to try their rice pudding dessert.

The lamb curry was too slow coming that they just removed it from the buffet selection leaving nothing but chicken. The tandoori chicken was a rare sight too but the butter chicken was decent. As far as dessert goes, the Gulab Jamon was good but the ice cream was too hard to properly scoop, given that they didn't actually have an ice cream scoop.

OJ jokes aside, Bonkerz is a place where road-hardened comedians come to make a crowd of mostly senior citizens laugh.

I went to Bonkerz a couple months ago looking for some inspiration.  I just wanted to see some stand up comedy and that's exactly what you get.  Cost is $30.  $20 if you're a local.  Some guys are straight up stand up acts.  Some get raunchy, others have ill-conceived musical gimmicks.

The venues are to be found in every nook and cranny of the city and you will spend the month wondering if you have stumbled upon random performances as the city streets are literally taken over by performers. You can spend all day watching theatre and all night watching comedy - it is a bit like heaven but trust me when it is bad it is worse than hell but that is part of the beauty - witnessing the real howlers! You also get a badge, or at least you should, at every show you view so you should have a lovely badge collection on your bag/tie/bra strap by the end of August.

What Lush does have going for it, however, is the lack of unnecessary chemical ingredients. They're a great proponent of natural ingredients, and you'll find cocoa butter, almond oil, and shea butter in many of their products.

Ocean Terminal is unlike any other mall I've been to- most mall's have limited views of outdoor scenery. At Ocean Terminal, however, there is a huge three story window that shows unparalleled views of the Forth. There is a Lush in this mall that is a little bit smaller than the Princes Street location- but this makes for a cozy atmosphere in the most unlikely of places- a mall! This is the Lush to go to when it is absolutely raining buckets on a winter's day. You can stroll around the mall contentedly safe and dry from the elements! The Lush Handmade Cosmetics company is one of my favourite companies in the world! They offer fun, and 'out-of-the-box' products that yo are tempted to try in the store. The smell of the essential oils and perfumes is intoxicating. The company has a quirky sense of humour- thus the names of some products: Sex Bomb (a jasmine bath bomb), Sonic Death Monkey (a chocolate and coffee (!) shower gel), You Snap the Whip ( a blackcurrent body scrub). The other thing about the company is that they are 100% ethical- they don't test on animals, and they use natural products. The store has to be seen by one and all as it will change your perspective on shops. And for anyone whose ever played Candyland or enjoyed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (either movie, Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp) this is the closest you'll come to it in real life- just don't eat the soap! In addition, the store puts out a newsletter which is absolutely free and is a really good read in and of itself. The sales assistants are all helpful and each one is a bit of a character- it doesn't seem like they are vultures or just after you for your money. They seem to want to help and they also seem like they are having fun at their work. They dance along to music and cut huge pieces of soap, I've even seen one sales assisstant throw a bunch of jelly soap at a window to watch it trail down- just because!

Oh, that smell which infiltrated and hijacked the senses of any passers by (even those going nowhere near the shop and taking active detours to skirt it) was enough to give you a headache. Not just a headache, but you could actually taste it. Perfume. Floweriness. Too intense. It made me feel sick. Urgh.


 Fast forward a few years. I'm on one of my eco-friendly stints and looking for a 'shampoo bar' of all things. Yes, doing away with plastic bottles and buying the shampoo equivalent of a bar of soap seemed like a great idea. But where to buy one? An internet search took me all around the houses of a lot of online retailers, and then I stumbled across Lush. Ah haa, she thinksthere's one of those just along the road from me so I could just nip in and pick one up! Sure, there's the smellbut if I can hold my nose long enough?


 That was it. My first Lush encounter. I walked into the shop, and it was love.


 The bars of soap laid out in the centre of the shop looked like cakes - I swear, I could have eaten them had somebody sliced me a bit off. Some of them certainly smell good enough to eat, and we're not just talking about that flowery smellbut cocoa and vanilla and coconut andand Yes, whatever did happen to that overpowering wall of floral aroma that I always used to associate with Lush? Well, either I've acclimatised myself to it, or it was psychological in the first place and nowhere near as bad as I'd remembered it being. And realistically, now that I understand the way the shop worksthey're not all about plastic packaging and bottles and the rest - sure, some of the products 'have' to be packaged like that - but they believe in minimal packaging and little paper bagsso of course all of the aromas are going to be mingling, merging and overpoweringthey're not all sealed into bottles!


 On the whole, Lush is a rather ethical retailer. Their products are 'mostly' natural, but a few do contain the odd synthetic ingredient. They're all nicely labelled however, so it's easy to make a clear, conscious decision over what you're buying. It's also nice to see that Lush are reducing the amount of products they sell containing SLS tooit's something I try to avoid whenever possible.


 The Lush staff in Ocean Terminal are amazingly helpful. They will immediately acknowledge you when you walk into the shop and offer to help. Yes, I know this can be annoying in other shops when you want to be left alone, but it's not at all intimidating in here. If you're just browsing, then say so and they'll give you all the space you need. But as soon as you get stuck over which product to choose (and you will, because there are so many delicious products to choose from), you need only to glance in their direction and they'll be straight over to give you all the help you need. I've spent a good extra half hour or so in this shop at times, just because I'm busy chatting away happily to the assistants about various different products and the different ways they can be used - they're as interested in hearing feedback from the customer as they are in handing out the advice themselves! It's nice to see they're so passionate about what they're selling. They'll frequently give you a little sample tub of something if you're just wanting to test a product out, and I virtually always walk away from the shop with a few extra little bits and pieces that they've thrown in my bag as freebies anyway. Plus, I always walk away with a smile on my face. Yes, my pocket's always that little bit lighter than I expected because I saw something new that I just HAD to try (even though it wasn't on my shopping list), but I'm beaming with excitement over my little bag of goodies and can't wait to get home and try everything out. It's sad, but this shop really does do this to me!


 Finallydon't expect to walk in and buy your 'usual' style of toiletries. Go in with an open mind and embrace it. We're talking shampoos in bar form, facial cleansers which look like rolls of sushi, deodorants in a putty type form which you take a pinch of and smear on, body moisturisers which come in bars that you take into a hot shower and smear all over you, tubs of shower jellyyes that's 'jelly' rather than gelall very unconventional, but WAY more exciting to try.


 Lush really is my favourite shop. And Lush at Ocean Terminal is where I feel at home - it was this shop which converted me, well and truly. I can't believe that I avoided Lush for all of those years. It was me who missed out though - I realise that now!","2qBxM_3i18ppnAIEkoRUzA",5,"2008-08-24",0,"review",0

It wasn't such a cop out as my friend had specifically asked for Lush treats as it's her favourite store. I ended up getting her a selection of goodies including a soap that smelled like fudge, a honey smelling soap and a couple of bath bombs. They were beautifully wrapped up in a box and looked much better than I could have done! As I'm not a great fan of Lush I fail to see the fascination my friend has with it, but I did receive excellent customer service by the friendly staff here. I got what I came in for and left a happy bunny.

I have to admit, it does smell great but I wonder if the shop assistants are haunted by the smell wherever they go. It must play havoc with the old sinuses. There are worse smelling smells to be haunted by though...

HOT TIP: If you're in any Lush branch and feeling a little low, give the bath jelly a good slap, guaranteed to cheer you up.","2qBxM_3i18ppnAIEkoRUzA",4,"2010-07-29",0,"review",0

 I'd actually forgotten how good the products are. The dream cream works for even my horrifically dry skin. The reincarnate shampoo bar works well. Jungle conditioner is hard to work through the hair but is super moisturising.


 Potion solid perfume is amazing. It smells like cloves and is so good (it's made from carnation, rose and orange (?)).

Firstly they charge about a $1.25 for a halal patty. They do have beef and chicken patty. We were two so we ordered one each. We ordered the Big smoke burger and Spicy chicken burger. 

Lets start with the taste, the beef tasted ok... I have had better but their chicken tasted good.  The patties were good but the bun was too thin to hold the burger together. Both burgers were cooked properly and were still juicy, they also put sauteed onions on top which help out as they put a tiny bit of lettuce leaf. The fries were to die for they tasted smokey and were very enjoyable.

I just had a hamburger.
They are very cheap with the condiments, all I had was mustard and ketchup on my burger and there was barely any on it. Luckily I waited until I was home to eat and just added more to my liking. McDonald's puts more on their burgers than this place did, and that's saying something!
I was not asked how I would like it cooked and that is probably why it was ' well done' . I normally like my burgers medium to medium-well and this burger had no pink whatsoever. 
I did not get anything else during this visit because I knew I was going to eat at home. 
Fries don't normally travel well.

I had a pretty good Big Smoke Burger experience on King West. I was hoping that this closer-to-home Big Smoke location would at least be good, but it was not. Unfortunately I'm not going to have my Big Smoke cravings satisfied without having to drive to Toronto. 

So I order the spicy burger combo and I watch the dude slap my patty on the grill. So far so good. I then watch the grill continuously flare up. I really had to restrain myself from being a back-seat griller and shouting out, ""Hey, buddy, how about you try controlling those flare ups, please."" I didn't want to be one of those people so I said nothing. 

I also said nothing as I continued to watch my patty shrink ever so quickly because of all the flare ups. I continued to say nothing as the dude flipped my patty over and over again when what I really wanted to do was yell at the top of my lungs, ""Dude, that patty must be done by now with all the direct fire it's received. Pull it now!"" 

Just as the dude is about to pull my patty off the grill, the other guy says, ""It's a spicy,"" so the first guy puts my surely overcooked patty back on the grill and covers it with grilled onions to warm up the onions. They left that overcooked patty with the onions on the grill for another three minutes or so as my burger loving soul died a little more. Finally he pulled the patty.

What did I end up with? A creosote covered charcoal briquette. Black on the outside, dry as MDF on the inside. I knew this was happening. I knew this was happening and I said nothing because I assumed people who are paid to cook burgers everyday know more than I and because I didn't want to be one of those people. This is what happens when you restrain yourself because you don't want to be one of those people. You end up with a dangerously  blackened (seriously dangerous, read the studies about blackened grill meats)  burger and a little of your soul dying as a good burger goes up in flames (literally!). I would have brought it back, but I was in a big rush and I didn't have time to watch them ruin another patty. 

The Big Smoke head office people need to get on this situation and do some remedial training for this crew. This is unacceptable. You can't serve people blackened, dried out patties. It doesn't taste pleasant and it's not safe to eat.","Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw",1,"2015-11-13",2,"review",0

I must admit I was impressed. There were Actually char marks on my burger and I could taste the smokey flavour. The ingredients tastes fresh and paired together nicely.

I can say it's better than McDonald's and BK, but I think Lick's is better.  It was almost $11 for the burger and a ginger ale, which is kind of pricey.  However, I don't mind trying new things. Also, even though this was a fast food joint, the service was good.  They said it would take 7 minutes and being the nerd I am, I timed it and it took less than 4.

I'll save my opinion/review of the Square One revitalized food court (spoiler: it's amazing) for another time, but I did want to comment on Big Smoke, as I visited the mall recently and stopped here for a bite with a friend.

I had been meaning to visit this place for a while, but never had a chance (and the time to actually sit down and enjoy a meal) until recently. When I stepped into line - the longest in the food court, I might add - I was expecting quality that was out-of-this-world. Maybe the fault lies with me for wanting too much.

What I got was... decent, but not worth the experience. After waiting in line, a friendly server took my order, and I was a bit surprised that it costs an extra $4 just to get a drink. Add to that disinterested cooks and people who were behind me in line getting their food before me (always a sticking point), and you can see that I wasn't starting off on the best foot.

The signature Big Smoke burger I had was okay, but considering the price (something like $13 after tax for the combo), it's past the point where I consider it to be acceptable value for the money. The fancy ingredients they listed out in the menu didn't really amount to much for me, taste-wise.

All-in-all, I've been having some issues in terms of the customer-service in this chain in general, and this location wasn't much better. Especially seeing workers playing with their cell-phones as opposed to helping customers (which was also something I observed).

So I'd be rather unlikely to return to this location with all that in mind.","0obwvwj5OSDJAjLvKJvHEw",2,"2013-05-20",0,"review",0

My massage effectively worked out some kinks in my neck and back, but the therapist used short quick strokes, not long relaxing ones. She chatted the whole time (to be fair, I WAS responding), and made it known that a massage therapy degree was a quick way for her to get a job and make money.

First of all, I called 5 different times to see if I could reschedule our appointment since our flight and times wouldn't allow us to make our original one. Each time they tried to find a new opening for us, and even a few hours before we went they scheduled us on a Sunday after I called. Nikki and Limmie were our therapists. They went above and beyond expectations for a massage!! They set the music to that that would fit my bf and I perfectly. They taught us (mistly my bf) all about tight and knotted fascia and stretching. Limmie went through a number of stretches and flexibility therapies on me. They had us laughing and having a good time the entire session, and we got educated without even realizing we were getting educated. My boyfriend is making sure he's stretching and treating his body better now after the session with Nikki and Limmie, and I now can't wait to come back to Vegas just to go see them for another massage!

When doing deep tissue I think it's rather important to stay on the tissue otherwise it can be a bit painful. I like a pretty intense massage & don't usually complain about it, but when it's done incorrectly it's frustrating. Towards the end I reminded him again about my neck.

I am not a connoisseur of massages, but I was a sports trainer who used therapeutic massage and I have fortunately been on the receiving end of 30 or so professional massages.  THIS WAS IN THE TOP 3 OR 4 of all time!

I believe they are moving soon, so I will not spend much time on their old location -- it was a medical office - clean, warm and lightly decorated.  Be SURE to verify their address if you think they are still at 1601 Flamingo - they should be moving down the street early in 2014.

My wife and I used a Groupon, so the price was downright CHEAP.  I don't remember the exact regular price, but I was surprised it was so low (especially compared to ""spas"" at the Las Vegas hotels!).  

They arranged us on two adjacent tables in a nice room.  Pleasantly dim, good air temperature (pleasantly warm), quiet instrumental music, and comfortable tables.

Pedro applied firm pressure on my request.  I work out hard and have significant  muscle.  Some massages can't get down in there easily, but Pedro succeeded.  The hot stones were a pleasant surprise and felt really good.  Pedro was attentive and frequently asked for feedback on the firmness of pressure, etc.  He understood my directions and followed them well.  There were several things that Pedro did that I haven't seen other LMT's do (some stretching, additional manipulations, particular pressure points) that were very welcome.  I asked for extra attention to my neck and shoulders and received it.

My wife reports she enjoyed her massage also.

The massages were not cut short and probably went a bit over time.  At the end, we both felt GREAT!  Overall, we DEFINITELY plan to make this a MUST GO location every time we are in Vegas!","039QG6ks4UYNkMA3mcII2A",5,"2014-01-09",0,"review",0

After a fail attempt at getting a table at Marcello's, my boyfriend's sister suggested Wild Wing as an alternative given it was within the same plaza. With a communal indifference to the dinner option after our blunder, we agreed. The warning sign should have been how empty the restaurant was with a single patron sitting at the back of the restaurant working vigilantly on her computer and nursing a beer.  The lone waitress didn't greet us, didn't nod an acknowledgment and didn't seem to give a rat's that we were there. Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over. 10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting. 

Now, it's a no brainer: you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related. However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option. So, you can imagine the gut sinking feeling when the waitress reappeared 15 minutes later and she advised they were out of the boneless option. 
(Why it would take 15 minutes to flip through the three page menu, [one of which consists of wing flavours to decide] in order for you to draw the conclusion that A: You want chicken. B: You want it in some variety, or C: You like to play on the wild side (see what I did there?) and stray away from the traditional by getting a burger.) (You daredevil, you.)  

Fine: I will meet your lack of boneless option and go with the chicken fingers. 

I should have taken the no boneless option as my third warning to run while I still I had a chance. 

Upon the waitresses arrival, we were greeted by plastic plates (why on earth any establishment would be serving their meals on plastic plates purchased at their local Dollarama is absolutely BEYOND ME) and quite possibly the soggiest, stalest tasting nachos. The salsa tasted rancid, and the lettuce was wilted. Upon the arrival of my entree I encountered what appeared to look like it had come straight out of a Hungry Man frozen dinner... the chicken fingers smelled off... like they'd been sitting in the back of the fridge. I was feeling ballsy, so I took a bite... I wasn't convinced. My boyfriend's GarPar chicken wings followed suit, and they were bland tasting.

20 minutes later when our waitress arrived to do a very delayed quality control check, she asked how everything was tasting. I explained to her the lack lustre experience I was having with my meal, she stared at me blankly as she asked me several times to describe how they tasted...they tasted freezer burned...they tasted off...how many other ways did I need to find in order to describe this? ""Do you want another meal made?"" No, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible...instead I asked for some more sour cream...I should have anticipated that upon her return, the sour cream would be extremely watery and very off in texture. An elderly couple helplessly attempted to flag down our waitress whom she ignored several times before the poor woman with an evident bad hip hobbled over to her requesting her attention. Given the destitute of people within the restaurant, it was easy enough to hear the woman explain that her chicken...well...it didn't taste like chicken. The waitress feigned surprise before asking: ""Does it taste like freezer burn?"" ""Yes!""

FACE PALM. 

When my boyfriend went up to settle the bill, he was started to find my meal on the bill. Upon asking if she could do something with it given my circumstances, she sighed heavily and said she'd have to consult with the kitchen staff. She returned two minutes later and said: ""I can give you 15% off."" My boyfriend now agitated by this response rebuttled that I hadn't even consumed even half of my meal."" ""Well, she ate the fries, right? I'll just charge her for those."" $4.99 on cardboard French fries later... and we were racing for the door with a mutual agreement to never return again. 

Wild Wing, there is a reason why a number of your establishments are closing, it's only a matter of time before you, your crappy chicken and plastic china at this location follow.","6LosnKz5z2TUkNrgzOwrUg",1,"2015-06-11",1,"review",1

It came with your choice of single sauced chicken wings (breaded/unbreaded/boneless), fries, a dipping sauce (blue cheese, ranch, sourcream, dill), celery and carrot sticks. 

I ordered the blue moonshine which was a mix of blue cheese and bbq sauce. My brother got the country girl which came dressed with their my thai sauce and pineapple. Honestly, the food took a really long time to come out but we both agreed that it tasted it pretty good compared to other well known chicken wing places. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful who did periodically check up on us but never offered us any water to start. Instead we just got the drink we ordered for the special which was a ginger ale ($2.99/unlimited).

You can definitely tell that this specific restaurant no longer anticipates for Tuesday wing eaters as the place is practically empty. The whole establishment just felt very run down and slow.

Our group was the only people in the place and we could never find our waitress she kept disappearing to somewhere into the back which is really unhelpful when we seem to the the only people in there for the entire time we were there.

It's still juicy and I really like its sauce taste and choice.  The blue moonshine night cheese dipping for my daughter's fries is a smooth texture and just right flavour which even my wife loves that.  I think Wild Wing's wing has a quality on food in average.  Portion is ok compare to its price level.  They have kids menu and the portion is just right.

Only thing I am not quite satisfy which I can tell is the service it provide with the price.  I mean the service from getting reception to table.  The waiter told us it is around 15 min but I have waited 25 to 30min but actually the place is not that full at that time.  Well, it is me and my son's birthday, so I don't want to ruin the time.   Wait time on the food is not fast but I am patient enough along with my smartphone.

Place are big, clean but definitely a sport bar is quite noisy for family but good for a big group over 10.  Be sure you reserves for table otherwise you will be frustrated unless you want to sit in the bar side.

I think I am one of the kindest about the reviews.  I cannot say Wild Wing is very bad in food, but service wise, it needs to be improved in order impress people to come back for a second visit.  Or unless they have a very good price or food quality or speciality, otherwise, it is even hard to impress a not-so-demand guy to come back a second time.","6LosnKz5z2TUkNrgzOwrUg",3,"2015-12-27",0,"review",0

We all ordered wings and I liked that it came with fries. While we were waiting for our order, I started noticing a washroom/sulfur smell and everyone noticed it too. The smell was still there even as we were leaving. One other thing that bothered me was the washrooms were single washrooms but there was no lock on the door.

The food was very lacklustre and the wings reminded me of frozen breaded wings you'd get at a grocery store.

That's why when I find a studio/gym/trainer that I adore, I like to shout it from the rooftops. Iron Butterfly Pilates most certainly fits into the ""adoration"" category. Why? Let me break it down for you...

The Studio: Is beautiful. Really lovely, frankly. IBP is in a converted loft (Atherton Lofts) and hosts different rooms for varying levels of pilates practice. There's a reformer room both upstairs and downstairs, personal training area and a room for group mat classes. It's full of light, zen like colors, gorgeous exposed brick and worn hardwoods. 

The Instruction/Classes: Pilates is tough, yo'. Thankfully there is a variety of classes to suit your athletic goals and style - ranging from physioball pilates (that's what I tried - and I'm feeling it the day after) to traditional mat pilates to reformer classes to more cardio based programs. Heather, the owner and one of the instructors, is the perfect mix of cheerful and inspiring. She won't let you get away with a half squat...just an FYI. 

Your first class is free and there are fairly priced packages thereafter. Even if you just want to try something new once or twice per month, Iron Butterfly has some fantastic options.","2iUGRHPUApKKJM8CBGqmNw",5,"2012-01-20",3,"review",2

I thought going in there ""oh, I do crossfit; I can definitely handle pilates."" Holy cow was I wrong. Pilates is not for the faint of heart. I've taken some pilates classes in the past and never felt pain like I did the morning after this one. Some deets:

Location: Atherton Lofts to the left of Icehouse in Southend. Beautiful studio shared with Moga. Bright, airy and a bathroom conveniently located right off the room in case you need it (or a break from a really tough workout, wink wink). 

Instructors: Heather is an owner and one of the instructors. The class I took was with another instructor, but I take crossfit with Heather and she's no slouch. Don't try to get away with anything while she's teaching or it'll be your head! 

Ultimately, pilates is a great way to diversify your workout routine and tone up those abs. It's swimsuit season, folks. Get your very own six pack at IBP!","2iUGRHPUApKKJM8CBGqmNw",5,"2012-05-16",0,"review",0

You can book a private session with an instructor or join in a group session - four maximum. Another great feature is there is a physical therapist on staff as well who can work with you on the Pilates equipment and help ""cure your ills."" In addition, Moga Yoga shares the space with Iron Butterfly so you have many options from which to choose.

If you are in the market for a Pilates studio, definitely visit Iron Butterfly.

I'm a student of the mat, and pretty much was a novice when I attended my first (free) class at IBP. Admittedly, I was nervous about exposing my inability to touch my toes without bending my knees and my shaky-arm push-ups. Fair reader: IBP is a no-intimidation zone. There are classes to suit all levels, the instructors give clear instruction on form and where to focus your effort--providing demos when needed--and discreetly help you into proper position so you can rock the right muscles and maximize your overall workout. Better yet, they are attentive to your abilities and limitations, and enable you to modify exercises to your level, Gumby or otherwise--all with the same great results.

While I've only attended mat classes so far, IBP has other offerings such as yoga, physioball and reformer classes, as well as private instruction. So I know I can mix it up with these, and the occasional special class options have been a perk (e.g. the CrossFit/mat class, which was a humbling yet much-needed push).

The studio is beautiful, the instructors are friendly and nurturing, and the prices are reasonable. So while I still bend my knees during a stretch, it's not as much as before. And I do feel stronger. Gumby would be proud.","2iUGRHPUApKKJM8CBGqmNw",5,"2012-04-04",1,"review",0

Chipped and shabby was my general impression of the place actually. Sure the hot chocolates were satisfying in a gluttonous, sickly way that you expect of a place named ""Chocolate Soup"" but apart from that the experience wasn't great.

Make sure you try their namesake drink. Or dish... their chocolate soup is so gloopy and amazing I'm not sure whether you eat it or drink it, but whichever it is it's definitely worth the calories. Just make sure you only order a shot of it, and not the large shot like I did... it's very filling and no, you won't be able to finish it without feeling sick for hours.

I visited when it was a quiet period during a weekday which may explain why it was laid back. Certainly I would reconsider eating (or drinking chocolate?) in a place where the staff weren't treated well. Customer service is a tough gig when you're ill treated. Although I didn't see any of that stuff go on when I was there, I would've felt awkward and sorry for the staff if I had.

The concept of Chocolate Soup is awesome - it's soup, and it's chocolate. Who knew? You can't go wrong with that. 

I agree with Lynsey, it's pretty sweet when consumed in vast quantities, but if you opt for something like a hot chocolate and a cake (or take it easy if you go for the chocolate soup) then you will enjoy it. You might get a sugar rush and come out in a sweat, but the likelihood is it'll be worth it.

A popular one with the tourists since it's quirky and original, but also popular with locals of all ages. Very busy at the weekend and it would get a bit full on if you were having chocolate soup on a daily basis, but great when saved for special occasions and meet ups. It's the kind of place you could take your mum, as I'm sure she will be bowled over by the idea of chocolate soup. Next thing you know, we'll be getting chocolate rain (I wish!)","2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw",4,"2010-07-01",0,"review",0

A cosy cafe off the Royal Mile, it has a cluster of tables inside and out and a handful of booths which are perfect for small groups of friends. As the name suggests, it specialises in all things chocolate related from hot chocolate and chocolate soup to chocolate cake, chocolate brownies, chocolate croissants and chocolate ice-cream sunades. The latter comes complete with whipped cream in a tall glass and a selection of toppings.

The problem is, the chocolate they use as the base for all the dishes is dissappointingly bland. We're talking creamy miilk and white chocolate rather than dark chocolate with a high cocoa content and real depth and flavour. I tried a hot chocolate and chocolate soup and was so dismayed, I gave up after a couple of sips of both. The chocolate brownies were equally dire and doughy - making me long for something genuinely delicious like a Green and Blacks or Valrhona bar.","2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw",2,"2010-07-23",3,"review",2

I searched online for Land Rover mechanic & found BIRKSHIRE Automobiles advertising as a Land Rover Dealer Alternative, I phoned them and I explained to them the situation, they told me that they had a Land Rover scanner and it will tell them the exact problem after they scan my car (more detailed report than the Regular mechanic generic scanner). I made the appointment and went there, They scanned the car and the same results that I already knew were on their diagnosis report, the only difference was in the bottom of the report it said: customer to Call US. they charged me 1 hour labour and they refused to refund me, they informed me that will contact their Tech team in England and try and figure out  what the problem is and will get back to me within 3 days!!!.  I then called Metro West AUTHORIZED Dealer and gave them the codes and they told me over the phone what needs to be fixed.  I did give Birkshire a 1 star because the washroom was very clean and Sam spent a few minutes in my car showing me some controls, however; he didn't know all the controls and what they are made for.

I was a little nervous about repairs and costs for Land Rover's. They assured me that when i purchased the vehicle it was in sound condition.
i am happy to report that other than required service and a $ 5.00 clip i have not had any maintenace issues.  I would highly recommend that anyone considering a Land Rover product purchase visit Birshire for sales and service.

They informed that the car would require $12,000 to $20,000 worth of repairs.  I had the asked them to replaced the spark plugs, clean the condenser, drain the gas tank to start. They charged me $1,800 for this work.  

After asking questions,  I came to find out that they do not rebuild their own carburetors. They subcontract the rebuild of them at $800/each.    

I sought a second opinion on the car.  Birkshire was correct on the problems with the car but the cost in parts and labor they quoted and charged were not competitive for Jaguar repair marketplace.  After checking our parts costs and labor rates, I discovered that their parts rates are double the market pricing and their labor rates are among the highest for Jaguar repair.  

The biggest problem is that they take so long to complete the work.  And they bill for  their slow work. Based upon their labor rate and the invoice it took them 11-1/2 hours to replace 6 spark plugs and clean a condenser.  My new mechanic discovered that Birkshire did not drained the fuel tank. Their distributor gaps were also wrong. Therefore they did not complete the work I was billed for.

She said the envelopes did not come in a different color (though she didn't bother to check), suggested a smaller envelope, and when we told her our invites wouldn't fit in smaller envelope, she made it sound as if it were OUR fault (and told us, in a not-so-nice manner, to just trim our invitations down).

I had gone in last week and asked a sales associate (Edward) to help me find a case for my new phone in a specific colour.  They didn't have it in-store, so he said he would look for it elsewhere and have it shipped to the store by the next day latest, but that I would need to put down a deposit first.  Fair enough.  The next day comes around and he calls me, saying he still can't find it, but that he'll keep looking.  Because I was going out-of-town in a couple of days and wouldn't be back for a while, I decide to look for it myself in other stores.  I end up finding the case I was looking for (fairly easily too, I might add) and naturally go back to the store to ask for my deposit back.  Edward wasn't there, but the other sales associate told me he'd let him know.  Today Edward calls me and tells me that he found the case, but since I had already found one, he could turn my deposit into store credit for me to buy something else.  However, my brother had also gotten the same phone, so I figured I'd get him the case anyways since they had already found it.  When I tell Edward this, he suspiciously tries to convince me to buy something else instead.  I insist on the case and suddenly he tells me, ""Oh, I just double checked and what I found wasn't the one you were looking for.  Do you still want it?""  Obviously he had never found the case, but lied to me so that he could keep my deposit.  Thankfully I was able to get my money back, but I definitely will not be coming back.

Stewart was basically the perfect salesperson. We went back-and-forth between several models and it never felt as if he was trying to upsell us.

High-five). 

Anyhow, I was there to help my parents find a bed as they both suffer from chronic back issues. They ended up choosing the i8 model and couldn't be happier with their decision. They've noticed a marked improvement in how deep they sleep and how good they feel when they wake up in the morning.

I also learned that since the beds are modular you can replace the padding and memory foam anytime you want and it's not too expensive.

First and foremost - I really dislike brunch. Something about paying $20 for a couple of eggs and potatoes drives me nuts. But Bivy was a game-changer for me when I discovered it 2 years ago - and still insist on travelling on the weekends to go back there today! Do yourself a favour and go.

- Intimate but not crowded
- Rarely a wait
- Generous portion sizes
- I almost always order the Ploughman Platter, but have ordered their salads in the past (Farmer Salad) and was not disappointed
- I bring all my friends and guests here - many of whom ordered their Croque Monsier and raved about this plate
- Great prices

You won't regret it.


Update:

I'm not sure what happened on a recent Saturday brunch visit (March 2016). I had talked up this place to a couple of girlfriends, and convinced them to trek a little farther outside of our usual stomping grounds to meet at Bivy. Holy moly. Everything I've known about this place was flipped upside down.

- Unbearably cold in the space. Teeth chattering.
- My beloved Ploughman Platter that has been consistent for years came out so different than usual. No pate/terrine, flimsy toast, canned(?) sliced ridged pickles - what happened here!?
- My friend's Croque Monsieur (also a usual fan fave) was so salty

Service was also slow and unattentive this afternoon.

The space is cheery and bright during the daytime and smooth and romantic in the evening for their new dinner menu. I've been a faithful daytime attendant for weekend brunch, weekday lunch, a coffee and a pastry-fuelled afternoon of work... I've always absolutely loved my experiences with their unbelievably friendly and attentive staff and their delicious food.

They hit it out of the park with their farçous (spinach pancakes) and omelettes, both of which I keep coming back to. I've also loved their tartiflette (potato/cheese tart) and the healthy bites I've had sharing plates of the kravitz, the ploughman, the gravlax... Basically I'm a well-meaning mooch, and my partner and I regularly wind up splitting our plates because everything is so tempting. Most of their meals come with a perfectly composed salad with mixed greens, thinly sliced radishes and a beautifully light vinaigrette and then their phenomenal potato salad...  Possibly the best I've ever had. It's definitely a step up from something you'd have at a BBQ. Everything is just really delicately balanced and flavoured just right.

Since they just launched their dinner menu, I've only tried it once, but it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Finding a decent and well-priced steak is a real difficult task in Toronto, but BIVY has it down. Their entrecôte steak frites comes with a grilled 10 oz rib eye prepared at a perfect medium rare as requested and covered in an understated herbed butter, fries that are seasoned just right and done to the perfect crisp without being overcooked and, of course, that beautiful simple salad. For $18.95! Pair it with one of their well-priced glasses of wine and you have the perfect date night. We'll be back again soon, probably tacking on an order of mussels to start since they look SO good.

I know I'm just gushing at this point. I just really love this place and it's the perfect local spot. It's equal parts cafe, brunch/lunch stop and great dinner option. A lot of restaurants wouldn't be able to juggle all those identities, but BIVY is great at doing simple, delicious food and providing a versatile ambiance with great service. I'm so happy to live near by. The only problem is that I'm constantly tempted to say ""Let's just go to BIVY"" instead of, you know, cooking at home and not blowing my paycheque on daily jaunts to my favourite neighbourhood spot.","10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA",5,"2015-04-09",2,"review",1

Upon entering during the day, the restaurant gives a relaxing vibe for customers to sit down and enjoy their meal or coffee.

Bivy serves interesting dishes, such as their French spinach pancakes and their different version of the French toast (which is more of a bread pudding).

The beer served are sourced locally from Ontario. The alcoholic drinks consists of beer on tap and basic cocktails. To give back to their customers, Bivy has a policy of giving one free cup of coffee to a customer everyday. This is an awesome policy and a great way to brighten up someone's day!

I tried their Mochaccino, which is their version of a mocha and I believe cappuccino combined. It has a nutty taste to it so it is great if you like that flavour.

Ordered the Countryside Farçous: French spinach pancakes served with Montreal Smoked meat, mixed greens & potato salad 12.95 (9/10). These pancakes were Gluten free baby. Not the traditional idea of a fluffy pancake, rather more of a lightly fried spinach and egg crepe. The smoked meat served with the pancake was a bit too salty, but was easily balanced out with the fresh mixed greens and potato salad. 

My lunch companions ordered the Salads with Bivy dressing 10.75 - A generous portion of fresh greens and a balanced serving of toppings. Something I will definitely try on the next visit.

Sometimes we like to do really good things, but at some point it ends up being too much; maybe we bite of more than we can chew.

The Bivy is a good spot in Little Portugal, but there is A LOT going on in this place. They serve decent coffee--not the best, not the worst--, they serve brunch and dinner, and they have a liquor license, which gives them the opportunity to sell alcohol too. This leads to an unfocused attention on certain items they may want to do better, the coffee being one of them.

I like the layout of the place. The tables and chairs seem to work well with the place and actually brighten the place up. The staff are very friendly and willing to serve everyone well.

The place is a great place, but I get the feeling they are a little confused as to what they want to be known for. Is it a great coffee place? Is it a great brunch spot? Is it a great place to get a night cap? There isn't an identity here.

Nonetheless, 3.5 stars for me because it exceeded a little bit of expectations, but could be more if they truly found their identity.

The service is decent here and we were checked on regularly and the server even shared her fav on the ICP. The food did take its time to arrive though even though the we went at off peak hours. 
The French Toast is a mini portion, it is quite good nonetheless. Raisin haters beware as they do use raisin bread. Poire Helene was just OK as I have had a lot better versions.

Espresso: Mild
Crema': below average

The interior is pretty much on par with most of the other restaurants that have popped up in this area in the last couple years, with reclaimed wood interiors with small candlelit tables. 

We started with the charcuterie and spicy devilled eggs to start. Both were tasty and appropriately priced, but the devilled eggs were admittedly not actually spicy. Still tasty, but adding a dusting of paprika is hardly spicy to me. Then as a second course we split an order of ribs, which were decent, but a little to overpowering in the citrus based acidity. 
As a main, I rounded out my meal with the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pulled pork was admittedly less acidic than the ribs and more savoury. The spinach in the sandwich was a nice addition but the tomato and mayo just made me realize the flavor of the pork isn't impressive enough if relying on additional sauces and juicy vegetables to affect its flavouring. 

In the end for 4 beers, the 2 apps, an order of ribs and 2 mains came in a bit over $100 after tax and tip. So for what we turned into a 3 course meal, was perfectly adequate in price and results. I'll come back, but admittedly there are a few other joints in the neighbourhood which have priority in my dining agenda.","10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA",3,"2015-03-12",0,"review",0

My friend got the ploughmans platter, a mix of smoked salmon, hard boiled egg, pate with a salad and other things. It was okay, and perfect to share both dishes.

SITREP

This is definitely one reason for keeping your Foursquare app running on your iPhone.  I got a 2-4-1 Rum & Coke drink special $6, so I'm not complaining.

THE SETUP

Inside the Luxor Hotel, Liquidity is a nice chill bar that isn't as pretentious as some of the other bars on the casino floor or on the 2nd Level.  It's also - as far as bars go - a bit off the beaten path in this hotel and so only experiences half the congestion of the other bars.

DRINKS

Besides the special I mention at the top of the review, most of drinks are between $5 and $8, and include shots with them if you ask for the right ones.  I'm not really a gambler like the friends, and so chill spots like this are really nice to take a break at, especially when engaged in a deep conversation with someone.

THE LOWDOWN

When hanging out at the south end of the Vegas Strip, this is definitely a nice bar to retreat too away from the noise.","1ovFbjcn13ovvMC94F2e7g",4,"2013-09-28",12,"review",10

I spent most of my time at the bar playing video poker, and getting comped drinks like I do with any casino bar.

My cousins and I were just looking for a place to chill/relax and get some drinks.  We hadn't seen each other in a while and wanted to catch up.  We dropped by Aurora (located near the check in desk) but there wasn't an empty seat or table available.  Next we went to Flight, but that bar was packed with people waiting to possibly enter the LAX nightclub.  

Thankfully we came across Liquidity in the middle of the casino floor.  It wasn't crowded at all, and were able to find a table with lounge chairs instead of just sitting at the bar.  The bar is located in the middle and surrounded by sections with lounge chairs/tables/couches that allow Luxor guests some comfort while enjoying their drinks.

I have to admit that although we were in the middle of the casino, it didn't seem as noisy since we were away from the crowds checking in, as well as those waiting to gain access to LAX.  It definitely seemed more spacious than Flight but not as roomy as Aurora.  

Bottom Line:  A welcome and comfortable alternative to the Aurora and Flight bars/lounges.","1ovFbjcn13ovvMC94F2e7g",4,"2012-03-09",6,"review",3

He then proceeded to mop it up and put some blowers on it to dry it. call number two to the owner and we agreed they would come back on Monday to redo. (This was a Thursday). The technician went out to his truck to retrieve the caulking gun to fix the two spots but returned empty handed because he could not find the gun. Oh and the grout was not sealed as promised! Saturday, as my husband and I left the house, we noticed a large brown stain surrounding the spigot that the technician had attached his hose to.

She explained that her partner (her husband-Leo) would be out Monday to inspect the damage. Leo arrived and told me that he felt that the brown stain was from a leak behind the wall and not from his technician not connecting properly. However, he said he would call We'd or Thursday and come out to clean the stain after the rain had stopped and the wall had had time to dry.

I'm surprised there's only one other review for them considering how professional & on top of things they were. 
My carpets weren't destroyed, but they had potty stains from my puppy along with beverage stains as well. They assured me not to worry and they would get them out (or as much as possible). To my surprise, my carpets look brand new! They were quick, yet took the time to make sure there weren't mistakes. They wore booties during the process to not dirty other areas of my home with the traffic in and out. I also loved that they gave me a run down of everything & made sure I didn't have any further questions before they began. 
The price didn't empty my pockets which was nice.. for my home (living room, bedroom, and stair area) was $100 plus extra for pet stain removal. 
Service Clean gets 5 stars and a recommendation from me.

I moved into my first apartment with high hopes of keeping it clean and receiving my security deposit back, however, between living with three roommates and having friends over - at the end of our one year lease we started to worry we were never going to get any sort of deposit back due to the tremendous amount of stains we had acquired in our carpet. Between owning three kittens, alcohol spillage, and mud tracked in from where we parked our vehicles, our capers looked like absolute hell. 
I read the reviews for Service Clean on Yelp and saw that they seemed to be reasonably priced, efficient, professional, and understanding. It also looked like they were available, good at scheduling appointments and provided free estimates. We needed to get our carpets cleaned ASAP, considering we procrastinated doing it until we only had one week left in our lease, we were frantic to find a place that could fit us in & not break our budget. 
Leo showed up on time and was excellent at explaining how the whole process worked from start to finish. Considering our young age, none of us knew what to expect or how anything worked, or if we would get dicked over on prices. Leo was very careful and kind. Myself and one of my roommates are both art majors and have a lot of delicate, large, awkward pieces scattered around the house. I was worried they would get bumped or ruined - but Leo was very mindful of all our belongings and nothing was damaged whatsoever. Leo and his partner were efficient, you can tell they work hard and fast, but take the time to make sure the job is done correctly. They wore protective footwear to not track any dirt or mud inside the house when they were going from the van to the house. They gave us each a pair as well which was awesome because once the job was done and we were waiting for our carpet to dry, we slid around in the booties on our fresh, clean carpet and celebrated with a dance off. Our carpets looked phenomenal, better than when we first moved into the place. Even our owner made a comment about that after seeing them! We received our security deposit back in full.

Je me suis tout d'abord inscrite à la branche sur Mackay dans St-Henri, mais la passe donne aussi accès à ce studio en plus de celui dans l'Ouest de la ville. J'ignore si le nouveau studio à Laval fait parti du même groupe...

Depuis mon déménagement (vive le 1er juillet!), c'est à celui-ci que je vais le plus souvent et j'adore! Mon gros coup de cœur de ce studio : les grandes fenêtres du mur de l'arrière et d'un des murs de côté. Ça fait énormément de bien de pouvoir laisser mon regard se concentrer sur une branche d'arbre, un nuage ou bien la tour de l'église pendant les quelques secondes de savassana entre les poses plus difficiles. Les profs ont tous des styles différents mais la routine reste la même peu importe qui l'enseigne. Il y a des tapis de couleurs différentes sur le sol pour que les gens puissent bien se placer de manière à y avoir assez d'espace entre chaque personne tout en se voyant dans le miroir, même les journées ou presque 40-50 personnes sont dans la salle!

Les toilettes sont propres et les douches aussi en général. La seule chose qui manque, c'est des produits/un espace pour nettoyer sont tapis lorsqu'on emmène le nôtre, mais à part ça, ils ont tout ce qu'il faut, jusqu'aux séchoirs à cheveux, shampooing, tapis de yoga, grandes bouteilles d'eau, eau de noix de coco, etc. Ceux qui ont peur de suer devraient éviter à tout prix.

First of all, it produces amazing flavourful soups which tempt you to come back day after day... Every day they have 3 varieties of soups and you get a large hunk of baguette to go with it as well. So for example a large cup of tomato & bean soup to takeaway is £1.70.  One day I was hesitating between two flavours and the lady kindly offered a wee sample for me to taste which I thought was a nice touch. In fact all the staff there are super friendly and always smiling, which is another reason to go there. 

Cafe Marmalade also does nice salads, wraps, sandwiches and cakes. They also sell portions of home made foods, e.g. lasagne so I would say pretty much all your lunch time needs are satisfied here :)","BLEahNnfVfSj6g8efxyWAw",4,"2013-04-19",4,"review",1

I told my friend that I would like to go conditionally--we could pop our heads in and if it looked okay, we could stay.

It looked okay, when checked out the place--maybe a little unpleasant, in that some of the tables were uncleared and so on, but this might just have been busyness. It was pretty full, with only a couple of seats going to spare. The woman who seated us seemed curt and sullen, however, there was a man who served our table for the most part (the woman refilled our tea once). The man was friendly, smiling and helpful.

We went for AYCE. And it was fine. I didn't get food poisoning, which always raises my rating of a restaurant where raw fish is served by one star.*

So it was fine. And the rolls were... fine. The ones made for us last night didn't look like they were made by a ""blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw"" (as another reviewer eloquently put it--perhaps a different sushi chef, or else she encountered she same sushi chef as we did, but at the beginning of his career, and how he's in that mid-career slump). On the other hand, perhaps that would have made them more interesting, at least visually? They were pretty standard AYCE, generally. Taste-wise, they were fine, but not fabulous. Each piece of my dynamite roll was too big to manage in one bite, and we all know that this makes for some messiness, as you have to do it in two bites, the flavours don't blend the same way, and unless you're that special combination of skilled and lucky, it falls apart while your'e chewing your first bite. But it was fine. Nothing to write home about (home being Vancouver, where sushi is generally yum and less uneven than the stuff out here, it seems).

One special note is the spicy salmon roll. Last summer at a sushi place on the Danforth whose name I do not recall, a friend warned us away from the spicy rolls. He said that they use crappy cuts of fish and disguise it with the spicy sauce. I had never heard of such a thing--we often have sushi out in Waterloo (as we live there part time), and it has always been fine--the same cut of fish as the regular roll, with some spicy sauce drizzled over.

Last night, I saw what my friend meant. The spicy salmon roll featured finely chopped salmon, mixed with the spicy sauce--and closer examination confirmed that yes, the lighter stuff in the chopped meat side was not merely sauce, but also fatty, less appealing bits. I tried a bite and this reinforced my friend's warning, which I now pass on to you, with the note that at least for now, in Waterloo, this is not the case. There, the spicy rolls are not crappy cuts of meat disguised by spice. But sadly, at least some AYCE places here, no doubt faced with higher overhead and fierce competition, seem to have decided to take short cuts where they can least afford to--on the food itself, while hoping that the flat rate AYCE pricing will make up for it. The fact that I won't rush back to this place indicates that at least for me, the pricing doesn't make up for it--I'd rather have a tasty bento box, well-prepared, than such mediocre AYCE. 

*I think my rating would more accurately (from the descriptions) be ""meh--I've had better"" because this is precisely true. But, most people seem to be writing really horrid reviews alongside their two star ratings, so I assume that 2 stars is actually more negative than that and three stars is more of a ""meh"" in practice. I'm going with that.","-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA",3,"2011-02-11",4,"review",4

For all the local foodies and those who prefer quality customer service. DO NOT go to this restaurant. Mariko Japanese was utterly disappointing.

For fear of ranting, I'll try to be straightforward about this. We made a decent size order on what we assumed would arrive in reasonable portions(it is an all you can eat after all) the sizes that came were gargantuan. Starting with udon noodles that was the size of a full entree(oversized) after a minor complaint to the owner who barely acknowledged our annoyance the rest of the food came.. Which was just as ridiculously large followed by more of a sour attitude. My boyfriend and I head to pay the bill and left promptly to take photos of the resto to review later. The owner rampages outside shortly after our departure and begins PUNCHING my bf.. Yes I said it my fellow foodies.. Punching incessantly.. Then runs back inside to grab two glasses of water and douse him and myself with it.. As well as an innocent bystander.. There are no words.. Other than BEWARE and stay away.

The servers seemed tired, but service was still good. We were promptly served our tea and water when we sat down, and the two waitressess tag-teamed our table returning multiple times through the meal to top up both types of drinks.

We came for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) dinner on a moderately busy Saturday night - there may have been 4 or 5 other tables being served along with us. On the weekends, the price is apparently raised by $1, so instead of it being $15.99 now, it's $16.99 on a Saturday (and I can only assume that applied to Friday and Sunday as well). (note: they did have the ""lower"" menu for $12.99 weekend price, but my buddy said that one doesn't come with Sashimi, so we went with the higher priced one.

The sushi was good. It wasn't great (I lived in Vancouver and have had GREAT sushi back in the day) but in my opinion it wasn't gross as some have suggested by any means. The presentation on our plates was also nice, as our multiple rolls and sashimi came out nicely presented (and our white salmon sashimi - which comes in thin strips - was presented looking like the flower of a rose, a beautifully artistic interpretation that I hadn't seen before.)

Sashimi was quite good. Nice and fresh. No complaints. Sushi rolls do come with a lot of rice, but they were tasty too. They had a few rolls I'd never seen before like the ""Excellent Role"" (I know, how awesome of a name is that!) which was shrimp and banana. My girlfriend and I felt adventurous and tried it and it worked really well in our opinion.

On the AYCE menu there was only 1 dessert, tempura friend Banana, which they pour a little chocolate over, and it was actually quite tasty. When we finished, they also offered us complimentary ice cream (Green Tea or Coconut flavours).

Overall, this place wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I've had better sushi, but I was spoiled living a few years on the west coast. The AYCE menu is pretty thorough with lots of choice, and the price is decent. I've not had much Sushi yet in Toronto since moving here, but this place was pretty good for what you got.

I want to say 3.5 stars, but that's not an rating option in Yelp, so this restaurant will benefit from the automatic round-up to 4-stars.","-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA",4,"2011-11-13",1,"review",1

My boyfriend wanted to celebrate a win by taking me to AYCE and we decided to finally cross off Mariko on our AYCE hit-list. For $16.99 all-you-can-eat, we didn't have any high expectations of the food quality. We just wanted to be full and be merry.

Food was average-below average but enough to satisfy. Tempura was never crispy (and if you think that's an undercooked yam tempura, no, it's just carrot.) The salmon sashimi was probably the only highlight of our night, though they were poorly deboned.

But oh, did we wait... I think we came in at 9:30PM and our first order didn't come in until 10:20ish. There were only three other tables. It was like this with all our orders until closing time. I guess on the bright side, we finally paced ourselves at AYCE and there were a set of flies that entertained us as we tried to keep them off of our chopsticks.

Service though? Really bad. Like, I don't think I've ever been this baffled by service in my life especially since my entire family (also Chinese) works in the restaurant scene. To start off, we were handed two sheets for AYCE but no pen/pencil. No plates for anything until we asked for them during our second order. Water has no ice and was lukewarm. I would not be surprised if it was like those restaurant stories my parents tell of places that rinse utensils in drinking water. Ha..

Communicating with the staff is terrible. They're always in a rush (to not serve the other customers) and were really condescending. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt especially if English is not they're first language when it comes to tone (since I understand this issue having interacted with so many ESL Chinese) but no... the staff is just plain grumpy 24/7. 

We were charged an extra ~$4 due to some miscommunication and after waiting for our waitress's 20 minute phone call to end, we flagged her down. We disputed this charge but instead of rectifying this issue (sounds familiar to some other yelp reviews?!) they asked why we even bothered coming here instead of the other AYCEs on Bloor. W-what? We were willing to pay the extra charge since it was a misunderstanding on both ends and it was only $4 but the immediate lashing out that occurred from wanting to get the situation clarified was downright unnecessary. They eventually removed the charge and we even *tipped* them (something I will regret to this day.) I was even more put off by how fiercely the waitress grabbed the money off of the table sans the tray by slamming her palm down on the bills and then clenching them in a fist while I was in the middle of exiting the booth..

Miso soup was very savoury. Salad dressing was awesomely tart. Chicken teriyaki was fine. Spring roll was fine. Tofu was superb. Mountain of food for a low price. Only downside was that the tempura was horrendous. It was soggy. 

When I walked it in took three minutes to be noticed, greeted, and seated. There were two servers and only four occupied tables (and they were standing about, not at the tables). There's no excuse. The menu is huge so a couple minutes later I'm still holding it in front of my face reading it and a server comes and says ""Are you ready yet?"" and I suppressed a ""Yes, I'm just reading now for the entertainment value"". I order and it takes too long to get to me. While waiting I notice there is a dinner ayce menu which was never offered to me. Oh well, not too hungry anyway, but would have been nice to be told about it. When she brings my food my water is empty. She looks at glass. Doesn't fill it. Ten minutes later she walks by, glass is empty, looks at it, doesn't fill it. Third time she walks by I ask. She still doesn't fill it. Five minutes later another server fills it. I must have tired out the girl by asking her for water because she disappeared but more on that later. As I eat I notice the floor is disgusting. Chopstick here, lump of rice there, no effort to do anything about it. I also notice the server that didn't disappear is just chilling up front drinking a bubble tea instead of working. I finish the food. Server walks by. ""Are you done?"" I say yup. ""Can I get you anything else?"" I say no. Wait 20 minutes, never see a bill. Get up and approach her. As I do I find server #1 sprawled out in a booth taking an effing nap! Can you imagine? Server two says ""Do you want to pay?"" and I suppress a ""No, I'd just thought I'd do laps of the place to work off the bento"". She starts looking at the menu and mumbling to herself. I don't have time for it. Drop 11.25 on the counter and walk out. No tip for the first time in my life. Won't be back.","-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA",2,"2012-09-01",2,"review",1

We have never really had an issue with service, in fact, because we are regulars, we have established a relationship with the regular server and the chefs; as such, when they are in we get special treatment (free drinks, special sushi not on the menu, etc.).

We went in for the 10.99 all u can eat...  The service was slow and sub-par  but this didn't really bother me... The food was really bad and the worst sashimi I have ever tasted...but still whatever it was only 10.99 right?  Well  when i went to pay they wanted to charge us 17.99, even though all of the banners say 10.99.  After a brief argument the one waitress called the manager on the phone screaming in Japanese  and finally charged us 10.99, still insisting she told us when we ordered that we were getting the more expensive menu??  SHE DID NOT....  This is where it gets good...  she than yells at me saying Im never welcome again.. I said fine...this is the worst sushi I have ever had and I wouldn't dream of coming back..she than barked  at me again.   At this point I had enough and told her where to go, at which point the waitress turned around and slapped me in the face twice  YES  she actually physically assaulted me!!!   But it didnt stop there!  She then shoved me into a table...After this I unleashed hell fire on her and ran out.  I'm still pondering pressing assault charges just not sure if i want to waste any more energy on it... I'm still shocked it happened....Difficult customer or not you NEVER lay a hand on a customer.

There are two options for AYCE. So, for people who only like Veg, Chicken, or Beef in their rolls and no fish you don't have to pay full pop.

The decor is in keeping with the nicer sushi restaurants in the area.

The Bad:

Way too much rice on the sushi. I know there is supposed to be rice on sushi, I'm not freaking out over carbs. This was out of hand. There was hardly any fish in the rolls! Where are the nice big chunks of salmon and tuna? 

The rolls were not well assembled. some where falling apart when picked up with chop sticks - the sign of a poorly trained (if at all) sushi chef. 

We like to order a lot of sashimi. The first round of salmon sashimi was excellent. The second round was clearly cut the tail end of the fish were there is more marbling and fat. This cut of salmon is not normally for sushi. It's creamier consistency is better for some rolls, but not sashimi. 

The severs were nice, but very difficult to communicate with. This is pretty typical for a lot of sushi restaurants in the area. 

The Ugly:

When you're given a menu and pen/pencil to fill it out, a 4cm pencil covered in black gunk is not what you want when you're ordering food. 

It took forever for our first order to arrive! I'm not expecting fast food, but at least bring out the first roll or two within 15 minutes.


***The lesson here: you get what you pay for. ***
This place is about 30% cheaper than other AYCE sushi restaurants in the area, and the quality of the food is at least 30% lower. I like quantity when it comes to sushi, but quality counts for so much more.","-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA",2,"2014-04-26",0,"review",0

I know I say this about pretty much every Japanese restaurant except Japango, Asahi and Yuzu no Hana, but this has to be the worst one in Toronto.

OBVIOUSLY it is run by Chinese folk, not Japanese, which makes it all the more obvious why it sucks. I asked for a substitution and they said: NO CAN DO, until I offered to pay more money to avoid eating crap. *rolls eyes*

I ordered the Wakame Salad, which came drenched in a disgustingly sweet sauce of sesame. Not a drizzle, a SOUP of dressing covering the few leaves of wakame is not my idea of a good Japanese salad.

The miso soup was standard but I only got 2 tofu cubes.

I also got the chicken teriyaki which was not what I was expecting, it came as a sizzling hot plate instead of drenched in that thick lovely soy sauce and flavoured beautifully. It lacked seasoning, was on a bed of horribly cooked onions and carrots, and I was so hungry, I ate it all.

But I am never coming back, and if you had a smartphone (unlike me, as I am internet-less most of the time I am out of the house), you would have yelped this and avoided it like the effing plague.","-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA",1,"2013-08-31",2,"review",0

-Water was brought to the table and we were never asked if we wanted anything else.  I certainly would have expected tea rather than water.  The refilling of the water glasses was labored at best.

-The sushi, sashimi, tempura, udon were all ok. The fish seemed a bit on the old side - kinda soft and mushy - maybe it'd been frozen? dunno.  The udon broth was kinda tasteless.

Are we alone in the universe? How is Mariko still in business? We may never find out the answer to that last one, but let's try to wrap our heads around it for the time being. 

Sure, it may be relatively cheap for an AYCE, but starving to death is also cheap. At least with the latter you can die a dignified death and not have your hippocampus tarnished with the memory of ever coming to this place. With poor service, a menu with text printed in the smallest size font in faded red (ask the staff for a magnifying glass if you don't have your electron microscope handy), low quality fish, and a whopping 7 conditional passes from Dinesafe(!) under its belt, it truly is a wonder how this place is still around. Considering the rising presence of Japanese food in the area, such an environment should've put this place out of its misery ages ago.

My first visit to this location was initiated by their signage.  They always seem to have some sort of special on, which is great for students.  They have a $10.99 AYCE menu (albeit VERY limited), and a $14.99 AYCE which includes sashimi (2 or 3 types).  They also have ""FREE DAYS"", where each day of the week, you get something free with your meal (ie. tofu & miso on Sundays).

Both times I have been there, service has been brutal.  There were times that the waitress was just sitting at a table with her head down, and one of the chefs would come over to serve us after our failed attempts to get her attention.

The first visit, I ordered à la carte, and the food came out beautifully prepared and displayed.  (see picture I will be uploading)
The second visit, which was AYCE, it was as though they couldn't care less.  It was all just laid on a big plate in rows.  The salmon sashimi came out in super thin slices, yet all still stuck together by some fatty tissue at the corner.  I have never seen sashimi cut so poorly in my life!  And the fish just did not seem like sushi grade.  I was so disgusted, I didn't re-order anything but basic rolls.  But even the spicy salmon roll was purely mushy, and it appeared that the chef hadn't cleaned his prep area between preparing rolls.  Rolls that weren't supposed to have fish eggs on them had a few scattered bits of tobiko around the outside, that clearly didn't come from just being on the plate.  It's so important for sushi chefs to use clean surfaces when preparing different rolls or fish.   For a second time, I was disgusted.

The interior is a cold blue, and the lighting is just as unwelcoming.  I think they've installed fluorescent lighting panels on the walls, and put transparent images of bamboo over them, as if they could act as sconces.  FAIL

We overheard a diner behind us asking the waitress to recommend something delicious he hadn't tried before, and she suggested the dynamite roll.  I couldn't believe it.  The customer looked pretty disappointed too.  If I had to rank the million sushi places on Bloor, Mariko would be wayyy down on my list.  If you're going to try it, my only advice is not to go for the AYCE.  It's just not worth it in the end if you can't enjoy your meal.  Part of the joy of sushi is the presentation and preparation.  It should be a feast for the eyes as well, and Mariko seems to think that it's alright to offer an inferior meal to their AYCE customers.

It was a chaotic, glorious mess of old and young Clevelanders bustling around grabbing local goodies. You couldn't walk 2 steps without accidentally tripping on a stroller. Let's just say it wasn't the environment for the easiest shopping trip.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that on days like that, you aren't expecting the best customer service from a swamped merchant at the market. But in a lucky twist of fate, Fosters Meats came through with the perfect amount of helpfulness, knowledge and patience. Hallelujah! 

Jason, Kelton and I stopped by the WSM for a roast and some fresh bread. We didn't think it would take long so we scooped up the first 15 minute parking spot we could find. The first steps we took inside I was thinking we might want to move the car--with this crowd we were going no where fast!

We didn't move the car, but we did start to make our way through the crowd until we spotted the first meat counter, Fosters. We were immediately noticed and asked if we needed help! Wow. So, Jason quickly explained what we were looking to cook and how many we were serving hoping to get some guidance on what to purchase. The Foster's employee cut us the perfect portion of beef at the right price and it turned out delicious! He even worked with the credit card minimum to make sure we were happy campers and got us out in time to move our car!

Ich habe längere Zeit in China gelebt und das traditionell chinesische Essen hier in Deutschland vermisst. Eine Chinesin hat mir nun das Sichuan Restaurant empfohlen. 

Die Auswahl ist sehr gut und reicht von Klassikern wie GongBaoJiDing bis zu exotischen Gerichten wie Tausendjähriges Ei oder Schweineohren. Sichuan ist eine Provinz in Südchina und das schmeckt man auch - Die Gerichte sind sehr gut gewürzt und zum Teil feurig scharf. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist sehr gut!
Der Service ist auch sehr herzlich und zuvorkommend. Lediglich die Atmosphäre im Gastraum ist sehr schlicht und einfach und erinnert weniger an das traditionelle China, was aber wenig stört.

Und ein letztes absolut überzeugendes Argument, dass es sich um gute chinesische Küche handelt: Wir waren die einzigen Europäer zu Gast. Und wenn viele Chinesen kommen und die Küche empfehlen, ist das wohl das beste Kompliment für ein chinesisches Restaurant.

Tipp: Leider war alles voll, daher Reservierung gerade am Wochenende empfohlen.","9WnyLoPC_WzD25IPd4d7qA",5,"2015-11-02",0,"review",0

Got his number through another contractor. Had him come out to measure and give me an estimate for granite work in the house (2.5 bathrooms, and kitchen). After 3 failed appointments, he finally showed up and gave me an estimate as said the work would be done in 7-10 days. Ok no problem. 3 weeks later and my granite still wasn't installed. Lots of phone calls, text messages, and voicemails and I still didn't have my granite. He finally got back in touch with me to install it at the end of April. Everything was installed so I finished paying him in full. I noticed the same night that there was a crack down the middle of the sink in the master bath. I called him and informed him about it and he said no problem he will have a replacement in 3 days. Here we are in JUNE and he still hasn't come back to replace it. He sparingly responds back to any of my calls/messages and when he does its ""let me call you back later this week"". At one time he even gave me a date of when he would install, and my husband and I both took the day off to make sure we were available for him and he never showed up.

But when  my sister in law told me about Maggie's I wanted to try it out! It's closer to home. I went in on a Saturday evening with my 12 year old son. He had some homework to do and that hour or so was a perfect time for him to focus on that, which to my pleasure, he chose to do. 
Now, there are not proper tables at which to sit and write or type. He was writing on his lap, but there was a hard surface in the form of a wide banister right behind him. I suggested that he turn his chair sideways, so he could place the paper on the banister and write. Which he did. He was quiet and focused. He worked. I read. 
Then I went to place the comforter in the dryer. Upon my return I found him squatting trying to write at a low side table. I asked him to get off of the floor and asked why he was down there. He said the lady working there told him to move; and that he knew better. I was surprised because I wondering what I missed when I went to move the comforter to the dryer. He said he glanced up when I walked away and saw her looking at me walk toward the dryer. Then she approached and admonished him. So apparently she'd sat there for 30 minutes while
my comforter washed, but as soon as moved she went over to speak to my son. Hmmm...
Now, I want to stress to you that I'm not some blind mom who thinks her child does no wrong. But he wasn't doing anything, except  studying. My husband and I teach our sons to be responsible, respectful and considerate; and so they are. 
When I asked the attendant what happened she was rude and unprofessional. When she saw me walking in her direction she had this look like she was gearing up for some kind of confrontation. I was polite when I spoke to her. She dismissed me rudely and directed me to the owner who explained that they don't want the furniture moved and that my son was wrong to turn his chair sideways. He said there was a sign asking us not to move furniture. Indeed there was but I didn't notice it until he pointed it out. It was not large, colorful or strategically placed. I apologized and explained that I didn't see it. He was short and rude to me. I was taken aback. I quietly told him that my son was simply studying, not running around making noise or anything. This is what gets me, since the owner is so over the top about his policy. There was a grown man when with pants all under his behind and bright red boxer briefs showing all in front of me, little girls, God and everybody. If that man understood respect he would have checked THAT and left my on task respectful boy alone. On the way out I suggested to the attendant that the next time she needed to give a child some feedback, perhaps she should approach the parent first. Her response? She closed the door in my face. These rude, unprofessional, mixed up people don't ever have to worry about me or my $25. If my son had been in there loud-talking or wearing his pants all down I guess he would have been ok. But he was a little too clean and a little too good and they had try to bring him down. It's all good. I will never go there again and honestly I want to print this review 100,000 times and post it up and down S Tryon; but Yelp will suffice.","6qDdAp-9A4GqWHwprrK3Vg",1,"2015-05-06",1,"review",0

As you walk in, the first thing you notice is that it is very dated inside, and the bar crowd. We were the only table in the whole place besides some people staying at the hotel watching the world cup and having some drinks at the bar.

The menu is very simple, not big at all. I wasn't very hungry so I just got a club house while my other got the lasagna. 

The waiter wasn't paying any attention to us at all, he was busy watching the game with the guys at the bar, we had to keep getting his attention. If we were the only table don't you think he should of gave us just a little more attention?

When the food finally came, I saw all these yellowish looking stuff on my sandwich, the description said mayonnaise NOT HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE! I dislike mustard and I was shocked to see honey mustard all over my sandwich, I have never seen a club house with mustard on it, so I was very surprised.

The lasagna looked very portion packed and when we asked about it, the waiter said ""its frozen, we just heat is up"" you would assume for 20 bucks at least could  make their own lasagna. What's the point going to a restaurant to have something heated up when you can do the same thing at home?

The moment we walked into the restaurant  was like going through a time machine. Boy~ the decor was immensely outdated; it felt as if we had just gone from year 2010 to 1980's...

The experience pretty much went down hill from that moment and on...
1. the waitresses were not very attentive at all even though we were THE ONLY table.

2. The continental breakfast only included the cold section of the break (breads, fruits and croissant...) but we chose to to add $6 for hot buffet because the croissants and fruits had obviously been left for several days (no jokes, the croissant had a kind of fermenting smell to it) and spoiled. 

3. Fine... so off we go to the hot buffet (the selection was very LIMITED) but we thought how can we go wrong with $6 buffet? WRONG! The scramble eggs was blah and the bacons tasted like it'd been several days old...

We waited a very long time to get an appointment for an estimate but the owner, Beth, was very nice. I was very specific with what I wanted to have done and it was very important to me that the replacement grout match the color of adjacent grout. We delayed placing our home on the market to accommodate their schedule. We let them know that our house would be shown to prospective buyers the day after their work was completed.
My husband was home when the work was done but since he works from home, he was not able to constantly supervise the work (not that he should have to). When I arrived home from work, what I noticed was the mess that the workers left all over my kitchen counter. There were large gobs of caulk smeared on the counter and even on my towels. When I went upstairs to see the master bathroom, I noticed immediately in the upstairs that all surfaces where covered with a fine layer of white dust. Apparently, the workers did not close the door to the bathroom when they removed the existing grout. I also noticed that the color of the caulk did not match the adjoining grout. The grout was smeared on & was very noticeable. The ceramic tile in the shower had been nicked by the saw that had been used to remove the grout. This could not be fixed unless all the tile was removed. The caulk in the kitchen did not match either. Bottom line---no matter what they say, caulk does not match grout.
Needless to say, I was furious. I had paid for what was a lousy job & had an evening ahead of me to clean the mess that was left. I immediately called the company & the lady who answered the phone was surprised that I was so upset. She assured me that the owner would call me & that we had the best worker on the job.

let's be honest- no one comes to the bullet thinking they are going to see amazingly hot strippers do crazy pole acrobatics and pop bottles in the champagne room. this is a dive. you come to the bullet for the following reasons:

-there are some hot girls here. there are also some girls here who know they have a face for radio, but work it out extra hard from the neck down to compensate. my favorite? this weekend i got a lap dance or 3 from a hot, super thick blond chick in little reading glasses. almost fat, but definitely phat. you just don't see that enough! 
-girls get in free. guys, if you use the atm, it spits out a free admission
-got a table close to the stage? for $1, these girls will go balls out: legs wrapped around your head, coochie in the face, motorboats for days, etc.
-need some attention form the lady on stage? get $1, go stand by the pole or lay on your back on the stage... they will get that money! if you are a girl, be prepared for them to try and lift your shirt up on stage. my advice is save it for the lap dance.
-lapdance for $10! guys, you have to abide by the typical rules. girls, get ready! you can touch all over the dancers. they can and will touch all over you. 

one time, back in the day, there was a hot latina dancer that had a nice set of implants, and was giving me a lapdance:
stripper: (takes my hands and places on her implants) SQUEEZE THEM HARD!
me: i don't want to pop one....
stripper: try to pop one. you can't!

I have, for the most part, shunned all AMF lanes, minus the one on Christown, which has sentimental value because that was where I pretty much grew up bowling. This alley, much alike most AMF's, has horrid service, from staff that range of their mid teens to their late 20's and many whom despite their bowling background know nothing about how to treat the customer right. Most people know that lanes always staff people whom for the most part have a pretty big bowling background. That's a major plus when hiring. Unfortunately, like I said, they suck at servicing the customer.

Also, the lanes and the area around are really poor. Like one person stated before me, they have old screens, which is not the case at any Brunswick bowling alley you may go to. The floor boards are extremely slippery, and it can easily cause injury if you're foolish enough to run around on the approach, let alone go over the foul line. The food is comparable to all other publicly traded bowling alleys: its over-priced and is horrible for you....DON'T EAT IT! Drink prices aren't too bad considering where you are at, but its still bad. Bowling prices are always market rate...If you simply go on AMF's main company website you can get coupons to lessen the $$ you are spending. There is no reason to not sign up on a bowling mailing list and get coupons, they save you A LOT! 

With all this said, I give it 2 stars. Its not the worst alley in town, although close to it. It needs MAJOR renovations, even something simple like getting new TV's would mean so much. Renovate, and you will see more business... I recommend you go elsewhere until they do just that. Go to privately owned and operated Let It Roll Bowl, just a bit down, with better rates and service. Go to pretty much any Brunswick, which will do much better on each level. Or, simply, choose another AMF, Scottsdale being the closest, and definitely a MUCH better option.

First off, while it doesn't look like much from the outside, it's pretty nice inside.  Nothing too fancy, but certainly well-maintained and clean.  I was honestly surprised how nice it looked once inside.

We went here last weekend for the Extreme Bowling (or cosmic bowling, rock n roll bowling...whatever you want to call it).  Couple of the ladies in our group were doing some research before picking which place to go, so they called ahead to find out the deal - they were told Extreme Bowling is $17 per person (plus tax).  It starts at 8pm and that price includes shoes and all-you-can-bowl.  All of this is true...until 10:30pm.  What we were not told was that $17 is for 8p-1030pm, at which point they empty the place out and start over again, and you can pay an additional $17 for 10:30-1:30.  Not knowing this, we arrived shortly before 9pm.  Sorry, but we're not going to pay $17 for an hour of bowling, then repay it again for the rest of the night.  The cashier was a nice enough kid, this really wasn't his fault.  But they were not bending on the rules either.  I can understand, but let's mention that little detail when people call and ask.  We were told $17 all you can bowl.  Not $17 for the first session.

So we decided not to bowl session 1, but to head out to another bar for a few drinks/dinner and then return at 10:30 for the 2nd session. We returned and did just that.  

The lanes are well kept, well maintained.  The balls are old and scuffed, but honestly what do you expect for a rental ball.  It would be great if they were new, but they're not.  

The bartender was nice enough and took good care of us, even if it is somewhat of a limited bar selection (nothing too fancy here, no Grey Goose only Smirnoff, etc).  We're not complete snobs, so we did OK.  

Overall, it's OK and it will certainly do in a pinch.  I really would love to find a ""good"" bowling alley in the area, so we'll keep looking.  I wouldn't refuse to return here, but it wouldn't be my #1 choice.","6pXwPMO871ir8ZnmyBbLEg",2,"2010-08-31",0,"review",0

It all hinges on the company, for  the serious good times begin when the sun goes down (and trust me, even in Phoenix, it eventually goes down.)

Never mind germs. Grab a brew or three and claim your lane. Warm those fingers up. Crack those knuckles. And most importantly, stretch those hamstrings and calves, for bowling isn't just bowling anymore. The lights dim and the music rises. This is where it's at - Rock 'n Bowl!

Every item here (with the exception of some sale items) is $29.99.  At this price, many of the finds here would be considered a steal, but for some items (like a simple t-shirt) the $29.99 flat rate seems a little over-priced.  I find the majority of their clothing is lacking in the quality department and I don't feel the price justifies the fact that your garment may or may not last you more than 2 washes in the laundry.  That being said, I do have a few pieces from TER that I love and have lasted me throughout the years.  

Extra props goes out to the fabric bags they GIVE you when you buy something, and they don't try stuffing 12768 articles of clothing in one tiny bag.  (American Apparel- take note)

I would recommend making absolutely sure that you actually want what you're buying (try some stuff on, sleep on it, then come back to buy if you really want it).  Inspect the garment(s) and ensure there are no rips, tears, or stains.  Exchanging stuff here is a BIG hassle.

Note their return policy (as written on their receipt):  

No refunds.  One time exchange only on $29.99 items with original receipt within 14 days and cannot be exchanged for other price point items.  If there is a price markdown on an item and it is being exchanged, the new price would be what the customer would get as credit when exchanging regardless of the original price paid.  Tags must be on item.  Sale/off season items cannot be exchanged.  Store credits are valid for a period of 3 months from the date of issuance.  

The Embellished Room holds the right to change/discontinue any promotion without notice.  All products purchased must be checked by customer before leaving the store.  Any claims or damages after wards will not be allowed. Scanned register price will be taken as correct and final price.","7f_edPZNJfP-kmUtFhIsOA",3,"2011-06-20",14,"review",5

I bought a dress here recently and it's already falling apart after 2 wears. I wasn't doing anything rigorous to make it fall apart. The fabric and the craftsmanship are of very poor quality just like the H&M and Forever 21 giants (to name a few). The clothes here are $39.99 and under for a reason. Keep that in mind. The worst part is, I don't believe there is any point in trying to return what I bought because the return policy is quite strict. Store credit only and one time exchange means that there is zero chance of me getting any actual cash back.

I do think that a lot of the dresses are stylish, but they are definitely not for everybody. I would classify a lot of stuff as feminine, girly, or chic. This is definitely not a place for people wanting something punky or tomboyish.

Lastly, I noticed that there's always just one person there. I asked out of curiosity one time if anyone else comes in if it gets busy. Guess what: no, it's the same person the whole day by themselves, they only make minimum wage, and they get no actual break. - To me, this sounds like these workers are being taken advantage of.

However, there are two reasons I can't give this place five stars. First, the staff is pretty unfriendly and rude. I walk in with a cheerful smile on my face and I am treated coldly by the person at the register.

Second, their sample policy is the most absurd rule I've ever encountered. You used to be able to grab sample cups and try whichever flavors you choose. But now, you have to go to the register, ask for a sample, the employee awkwardly stands there while you tell them which sample you want, and he/she serve it to you. Excuse me, but I am NOT five years old. I don't need someone to serve me my fro yo samples--no other fro yo place I've been to has done this. One night I walked in and the place was absolutely crowded with customers, but the employee left the register and a long line of customers in order to serve me samples.

I was surprised at the large selection of flavors that Yogurt Vi had to offer, although only 2 flavors were ""true fro-yo"" with the tart and tangy flavor. The other 8 options were essentially low-fat versions of soft serve ice cream. While I applaud the shop for trying to appeal to a larger mass, I was a tad disappointed that I only had 2 options of the actual fro-yo, neither of which were the original flavor. Hence the 4 star rating. I did like the selection of toppings they had to offer, everything from fresh fruit to the typical sundae accouterments like hot fudge and nuts. The ambiance is much like that of most other yogurt shops, bright colors, clean lines and fun music playing.

I expected the place to be mobbed - a la any Pinkberry I've ever been to- but...it was crowded but not unbearable, considering that they were giving away free frozen yogurt. Granted, the weather wasn't the greatest, but when I hear ""free frozen yogurt"" I go running. 

Similar to other yogurt shops, Yogurt Vi offers a selection of tart and regular yogurt flavors. All but one flavor - red velvet - are fat free but all yogurts have the same pro-biotic benefits as non frozen yogurt. (at least until you slather chocolate sauce on top of everything) 

There are more toppings than I can name here - everything from chocolate sauce, to fresh fruit, to candy pieces, to dried cereal. This is the Happy Dog of yogurt. You pay by weight, though...so the more goodies you pile on top, the more you'll pay. And if you're heavy handed with the yogurt machines (yes, you get to put it in a dish yourself!), you might not leave enough room for said toppings, so fill your cup carefully, k? 

In my mind, Pinkberry is the gold standard of frozen yogurt shops, but the flavor of Yogurt Vi's tart yogurt is very similar to Pinkberry. I'm knocking off a star because of the self service nature of the shop. I saw a little girl touching the toasted coconut, and that's not something that would happen in a shop where the yougurt-istas dole out the toppings for you.

When you enter, you can get 2 free sample tasting cups. There's so many flavors, and they keep adding more (recent one is the maple bacon one? Haven't tried it but will go and try it when I go back). They have the swirl and mix function too on the machines, so you can get two flavors swirled together! I've tried a bunch of their flavors, but I normally stick to plain tart.. just the way froyo should be. Grapefruit is also yummy if you want a little fruitiness to the yogurt. I love that unlike Pink Berry and Red Mango, you can self scoop your own toppings, and then get charged by weight. At the non self-serve stations, they give too much yogurt, and not enough toppings, but this is not a problem at Yogurt Vi. 

So... my yogurt is always: a swirl of plain tart, lots of mochi, lots of fruit. They have popping bubbles as toppings now.. those are fun. They pop in your mouth when you put a bit of pressure on them. Not bad for price either, usually around $4 for me. I think they charge $0.46 per ounce.","0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw",5,"2012-05-04",3,"review",1

I found this place online after my regular place had to cancel on me due to an emergency. Since I had an event to go to I figure I'd try a new place. I asked for 2D volume extensions, I wanted lots of volume with thin short lashes. I had this look in mind and described it to her, which she acknowledged to understand without asking me any questions. The end result was very different than what I wanted. Instead of a very natural look with thin and short lashes (I specifically asked for short so that they don't hit my glasses), I received a dramatic barbie look. It looked like striplashes were applied, as the lashed were very uniform looking (straight across almost), and although she said these were the second thinnest ones they carried, the lash was too thick for my liking and very inflexible (which, as I later describe, makes it prone to falling off. It leads me to believe that the pictures on their gallery are not their work, or at least not from my technician. I waited a day but the look didn't grow on me. I took drastic measures and trimmed the lashes with scissors so that they were closer to my natural length. After that, the look was much better despite the blunt ends of the lashes. But then I noticed that they were falling out so quickly! Every day a dozen or say came off each eye. By the end of the week half of the lashes were fallen out on one eye and maybe a third on the other. Keep in mind I don't wear eye make up, mascara or anything else requiring rubbing in order to preserve my lashes. I ended up having to book an appointment at my regular place at the 1 week mark (my regular place lasted for 1 month). I should note that the technician saw I wasn't very pleased at the end of it, and she offered that she could take off a few lashes in a few days, but frankly the amount of lashes wasn't the problem..  will not be returning and would not recommend this place for a natural look.","4JBDCxTWTqDmJ3IaDSr9cg",2,"2014-03-30",0,"review",0

Even a dim sum restaurant owner in San Francisco agreed with me.  This is my favourite cheap dim sum spot in Toronto, and I've ne ver had a bad meal.  There are other places that are fancier or with a bit more variety, but you will pay significantly more.  Your choice!

I've been going here since it was called Imperial Gourmet Garden.  Then one day they closed up shop, changed the name on the door, and reopened with this new name.  All the same people out front, and presumably in the kitchen.  The dim sum has always been tasty, and quite the bargain during the week.  Pay a little attention to the cart-pushing-waiters...you might just learn a little Cantonese!

The beef ribs are excellent, and quite hard to find many places.  Also, malai go is super tasty...it's like steamed sponge cake.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.  On a Sunday, get there before the crowds swarm the place at 11:30-ish.","6KJJN6dm5T85foIo_pVKBg",4,"2009-03-31",3,"review",1

This Chinese dumpling is served as part of the countless dim sum carts at Yiu Wah Restaurant. Dim sum, meaning ""from the heart"", is an anytime food but best had from 11:30am to 1pm - that's when the carts are at high volume sending around your favourite dishes (which go for $2-3 for a small dish but when you get a whole bunch for a full table of hungry people, your very satisfying lunch will only cost you 8-10 happy dollars). The only thing is you might not see the same food carted around in every visit. They have their usual but when they'll show up is always a fun mystery.

There is an obvious language barrier here but so worth it. Don't be ashamed to just point and nod at food here. It's socially acceptable.

Among my favourites:
* the aforementioned shaomai (w/ pork)
* sweet & sour pork
* steamed bean curd rolls
* pork bun

A surprise hit with me:
* crab balls

A MUST HAVE!:
* garlic green beans (the BEST I've ever had ANYWHERE! But order this from the waiter once you sit down because this does not get carted around with the rest of them).

Also, get the table by the kitchen. The food is hot, fresh and it always goes to you first. Of course, you'll have to fight me for it should we be there at the same time.","6KJJN6dm5T85foIo_pVKBg",4,"2009-06-26",2,"review",3

The pork chops were grilled pretty well and had a good taste, but were really more along the size of a lamb chop.   One bite of the coleslaw and I was done with it.  It was a creamy based slaw with little to no taste.  I would bet we could find a pre-made container from one of the big-box warehouse joints.

Our server was very good and attentive.  She helped with the menu and gave us plenty of time to unwind from work over our beers before ordering.  If I could pair the server with a better food experience, then it would have been a much better visit.

The first thing we noticed was that it was pretty cold in there. Either they didn't anticipate enough clientele to be worth heating the place or they figured they'd be so busy the body heat would warm it up. Either way, it was kind of uncomfortable.

My salad and my girlfriend's soup were both good so we got off to a good start food wise. My steak was good, though I was disappointed there weren't any dinner rolls. The baked beans I got looked a little pureed but they were very good. I wanted a baked potato but they didn't have any. I got mashed potatoes instead but didn't like them because they were chunky (kind of like potato salad).

My girlfriend said her steak salad was good, but the breadstick it came with was undercooked to the point it was cold in the middle. The chocolate cake we had for dessert was very good.

The service itself was pretty weak. That would have been understandable if it was very busy but there were only a few other people there so that was disappointing. The bathroom decor was great but it was pretty filthy in there. Again, not sure how that could happen based on the lack of customers.

The bad things it has going for it are: 1) there are MANY other alternatives that serve the same types of food (american sports bar food)- they're not setting themselves apart 2) beer selection is slim compared to the old Boneyard downtown near gateway. When I think of Boneyard, I think of 'vast beer selection', but you but don't get that here.

The Good things are that the food is good, service is great & personal, and the kids like the TVs & Video game room. We'll go there again, but after we've done the rounds on the other place. If they increased the beer selection to include craft beers/ beers you can't get at similar genre restaurants, we'd prolly go there more often. 

This place seemed dead for a friday night, hopefully its busier on the weekends. I would like to see this place work out.","1_yXNlfbGSn3pGjzNB99Yw",3,"2011-11-12",1,"review",0

The night started out pretty slow (and we got there at 11:30), but come around 11:50 (10 minutes before the cover charge goes up) the place went from 0 to 100 in seconds! The music was pumping and the crowd was awesome. Great group of people having a blast. 

The booze selection was fairly basic, beers and basic bar rail - what you'd expect from a regular club. And while the staff were awesome at taking care of the crowds pretty well with only 2 bars and 3 bartenders the line-ups to get a drink were long.

Those minor notes aside, the music was fantastic and the drag performances were awesome (it was my first time seeing one).

There was no pushing, no perversion (well.. ), no rude snobs....it was just love all the way around!!

Buddies usually just keeps one room open for dancing, but on really crowded nights, they will open their second room. Somehow, even when the space is tripled, it's still packed and sweaty--spelling out a good (but post-shower-necessary) time. Of course, you will find mostly gay guys here, but there is a sprinkling of girls thrown into the mix.

Drinks are reasonably priced and the bar is efficient. The line outside is also pretty fast. It's the little things like these that add up to a great experience. Little things like how you get stamped with PERVERT upon being granted access (careful to remember to wash that off before work the next morning...).

Best tip I can give is to dress casually and, if in doubt, go with less. You will warm up quick with all the bodies and the alcohol.

And do not wear any shoes that you care about. They will get blackened. Luckily, the black will come out of canvas shoes quite easily. It has become part of my morning-after routine to scrub my shoes down with a toothbrush and some dishsoap.","6KL0lRKtgTof-NoFuiXwdA",5,"2013-07-03",3,"review",1

Although the prime function of this space is a theatre space - they also throw a fucking, mean queer parties on Friday and Saturday nights. 

As a queer/gay club, I really enjoy Buddies. The crowd is somewhat mixed between men and women and typically pretty laid back. This is probably one of the least pretentious queer venues I've been to in Toronto and the crowd tends to be very friendly. The music is pretty good (but it really depends on who is DJing, like any other club). When it's a big night, like Hallowe'en or a pride party, they open up the entire club and have a different vibe in each of the rooms so if one room isn't doing it for you, you can try the other room. 

The staff are pretty awesome and the beer is reasonably priced. The monthly drag show Rendezvous is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it.

It seems that most of the shows they produce are racy, awesome, and queer-themed. It's a great venue that deserves a lot of support for funding and putting on phenomenal theatrical programming that historically wasn't or hasn't been produced elsewhere. 

This is my go-to place when I want to suggest a fun club/bar for a mixed crowd (queer men and women and open-minded straight friends). Definitely go ready to have a great time and you'll probably enjoy yourself!","6KL0lRKtgTof-NoFuiXwdA",4,"2010-04-05",5,"review",2

First off, the service is AMAZING! Staff are always extremely friendly and attentive and food comes very quickly, no matter how busy it is, although I usually go at lunch on weekdays so it is not overly busy.

The salads come in 2 sizes, small and large but small is definitely meal sized, I wouldn't order a large unless I was starving or sharing with somebody. My go to is always the Chinese chicken salad. The dressing is perfect and there's a good amount of chicken. I also recently tried a bite of my boyfriends salad, he got the seafood cesar. The name to me sounded bizarre but it had crab and shrimp and was actually quite good!

I haven't tried many other things on the menu because I tend to stick to what I like (selective eater over here) but I have tried their egg drop soup in the past which was very good as well as the roast beef sandwich.

Dr. Deli violates one of my cardinal rules of dining out: they serve food that I can make at home. Salads? Sandwiches? Soups? Stuff I've been banging out since Home Ec class. 

What's unforgiveable is that their food turns out worse than mine. Undercooked pea soup is grany; salad leaves arrive with brown edges, wilting under puckery-sour dressings. Coffee is zombie-grey. 

Bread arrives with the standard packets of shelf-stable whipped butter. 

I go to take one. 

It's already open, and the butter is missing except for a crumb-laden smear in the miniature plastic tub.

Anyway I went in and ordered their Chinese Chicken Salad small sized for $6.99. I chose small because looking at the large size it seems like too much salad. I also ordered with their sesame dressing.

Along with the salad I ordered the bacon and cheese potaato skins as the appetizer for $5.95. 

So I got the salad first. Surprisingly the bowl was not just for show, it was quite full. Lots of veggies (which I was after), some pieces of chicken, Mandarin orange slices, and some fried noodles. The tart sesame salad dressing blends well with the salad.  Don't throw the entire dressing into the salad, just do a little bit at a time. 

However, something was missing in order to make me fully happy. Thankfully the tato skins arrived and after taking a bite, the taste just balanced very well.

Almost just walked by but everything was sooooo yummy looking I had to look twice, and my love for bath bombs lured me into the store haha! As I walked around and wanted to by everything, I decided to ask the worker if she had anything for a facial acne wash. The worker was extremely nice and friendly and introduced to me Rhasoull Clay, saying it helped her with her acne. Me having tried brands specifically for acne like Proactive, Neutrogena, etc to no avail decided to give her referral of Rhasoul Clay a try. Thinking the store was just for pretty and body soaps, not specialized in acne, I tried the wash daily not getting my hopes up. I wasn't that extatic about the herbal smell, haha but I was just being picky. This product was amazing! The rhasoul clay soap bar not only stop my blemishes but also closed my long term self concious big pores! I thank the lord no facial wash could or had done this for me. I wish they shipped their soaps online, I would by often and I wish they made more acne, pore clensing or other facial centered soaps like anti aging. This store was amazing, and cute nonetheless!

Don't dump your pet turtle or fish into the pond here, or anywhere else. It is probably a not native species (see the red eared slider turtles and goldfish/koi/asian carp)

 they ruin the environment here. If you are going to buy a pet either take care of it until it dies, eat it, turn in into a hat or euthanize it. Just don't destroy everyone's ecosystem please.

The scenery is always nice here in any season although it gets very muddy here during the spring/rain. 

plenty of animals here in various barns and all fairly organized, the upper part of the farm is where the animals are and two very beautiful ponds are in the lower part.

Equally rude was the waiter who actually rolled his eyes at people who couldn't decide what to eat, and who got in a shouting match with one couple over whether a steak cooked 'medium' had any red in it.

On top of that, the two people that ordered the sea bass were treated not only to some cheaper, tasteless fish in the guise of a bass but both were sick that night.

They might have two locations.  The one we visited was on 410 Place Jaques.  We were in the Old Montreal part of town on Saturday June 8 looking for a spot to eat.  It was the Grand Prix week-end so naturally a lot of places were full.  It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus.  

Finally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters.  The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh.  I love seafood so we were sold.  Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision.  The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio.  There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.

we ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.  They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain).

On to mains.  Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon.  Both were awful.  the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour.  The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process.  The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty.

VERDICT:::
very pricey, food quality sub par, service left much to be desired. I am surprised we did not get sick. I would not go back if you paid me.","8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg",1,"2013-06-11",0,"review",0

I left the place feeling happy i picked it. 
Saturday morning my son and I arrived then Samantha introduced me to Debbie ( she cuts colors and does Keratin and once again i found her to be knowledgable and so kind.

Staying upstairs in the small yet lovely seven room Le Relais Lyonnaise (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hotel-le-relais-lyonnaise-montreal#hrid:tNEe9qqV1iexbFUbNqaS8g), the kind owner explained that he also operates this cafe, and that breakfast is included for guests in this public cafe.  (That was a nice bonus as when booking the room there was no mention of a free included breakfast.)  

My review is only for the breakfast as I didn't come for any other meals or for the attractive selection of desserts in the displayed fridge (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=WVECS2J92y8C0xZqD2aA-g).  

Every morning during my stay I had a bowl of cafe au lait and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=JIEPOJeoTRAPB0MBK5b_lw

The breakfasts were quite hearty and ranged from omelets (I had a nice cheese and herb omelet one day) to crepes to bagel with lox.  

My favourite breakfast of the bunch turned out to be the bagel with lox.  They served a fresh bagel covered with a very generous amount of lox.  Cream cheese was served on the side, along with a side salad (typical mixed greens like from a market served with a nice dijon mustard based dressing) and some fresh fried potatoes (these were exceptionally tasty).  I've never had salad and potatoes with my breakfast bagel before, but it somehow worked and turned into my favourite breakfast offering at the cafe.  Here is a photo of it:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=8ldkGMWDtAFMo5NidT5EfA

You might get swept up in the romance that is Montreal and innocently assume that all restaurants on the street are going to be delicious and serve quality cuisine.  This is not always true.  Sure, the atmosphere helps, and the cafe diners on the front patio appear to be enjoying themselves.  But, once you taste the food being served, you may not be sold.

They serve fresh squeezed juice, so everyone at the table ordered it.  Not realizing that we just spent almost $20 on juice even before ordering food.  The fabulous looking bread and pastry counter is not filled with items made in house, but made elsewhere.  Instead I was served a decent croissant, but nothing worth mentioning.

The worst part of the meal were the buckwheat crepes.  We had buckwheat crepes a few days before at a different restaurant across the street and loved them.  So, we thought that experience could be continued at Brioche Lyonnaise.  We were mistaken.  The room temperature, floppy sponge crepes given to us were not fresh and had barely any fillings.  Nor were they served with a side of anything appetizing to try to make up for their mistakes.  The chicken inside of the chicken pesto crepe was cold and dry, and barely any cheese to soften the blow.

We were in a hurry so stupidly decided to just go for lunch in the first non-chain restaurant we found on St Denis. BIG MISTAKE. I sort of blame myself as if I had actually looked at this place more clearly I would have noticed how grimy and dirty the outside was. It was also completely empty despite there being hoardes of people in local competitors.

Service started out a bit weird. I asked if they had iced coffee (not on the menu) and the server replied: ''I could make you one I suppose''....Odd. Anyway, I ordered an iced latte as well the french toast with fruit and my bf ordered the croque monsieur.

I went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were. The bathroom stank!! Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag. I then saw him put it in a microwave in the grotty kitchen. $11. French toast. MICROWAVED?!

Stupidly, I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and didn't say anything. My iced latte arrived. It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE. Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed. When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink. It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED.

The food arrived. The french toast was as gross as it looked in that plastic bag. It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE. the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut. My bf is NOT a fussy eater, but took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''. We were both that appalled. We eat out a lot, and have travelled a lot, eating in all sorts of restaurants, and this was the first time either of us ever left any restaurant anywhere because we were so disgusted with the food quality.

What was most interesting was that neither the servers nor the manager were particularly shocked when we said we were leaving and refused to pay. They didn't even protest, offer us anything else or defend themselves for charging $11 for microwaved french toast. After asking us for a bit of clarification, they simply said ''sorry, ok'' and shrugged their shoulders. I think that says a lot - I got the impression we were not the first customers to have done this recently.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We really should have just gone into the Subway next door.","28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ",1,"2014-09-29",0,"review",0

-Crepe: I had the ratatouille with mushrooms, egg, and tomato paste. It is wrapped and presented in the most beautiful way. The taste was not so great, but this could have been a result of me eating it cold on my drive back down to NY so I will forgive and forget.

-Desserts: I cannot list all of the desserts I have tried here, because that would be an entirely long list. Just as delicious as they look, they ARE in fact, delicious. I am not a big fan of desserts that are too sweet, so I had to appreciate the lightness and subtlety of the fruit tarts. 

Perfect for bringing back gifts for family and friends.

Service is a hit or miss depending on the waitress. Bear in mind that they take orders, prepare the food, AND serve it. I initially wondered whether the mediocre service was because of cultural differences, but I just realize that it wasn't and that this place is just poppin' and busy as can be.

Super long wait at the non-crowded bar while I had the pleasure of watching the male bartender flirt with the female waitstaff for over 5 minutes. No acknowledgement or apologies from the staff for severely sub-par service. 

Detailed review: The service is just plain awful. I've been a few times now before deciding to finalize my opinion and write a review, and after my last visit this past weekend I'm compelled to warn people to stay away if you're looking for a place with anything resembling even mediocre service. I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order. It was not busy, and there is no excuse for the wait - I had to watch the male bartender flirt and laugh with the female waitstaff the entire time. He never made eye contact or even bothered to acknowledge my presence the entire time I waited. When he finally came over, it was after he took the order and brought beers for the guy who stood next to me, and had only just recently ponied up to the bar about a minute previously. When I finally got my drink order (a very simple whisky cocktail and a draught PBR) the cocktail ended up being one of the worst I've ever had in my life. I don't understand how someone could mess up a simple cocktail so badly - I even asked a few friends to try it to make sure I wasn't overreacting. Their disgusted looks after they each took a sip proved me right. My experiences at this place in the past were warning enough, but after this last visit I will never go back.","DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA",1,"2014-03-17",1,"review",0

This is the type of place that you would normally find in NYC, LA or Nashville, so its a great addition to Scottsdale.

Went here for a free show--a touring band from Norway. The band was good, sound was good, vibe was good--until I walked up to the bar. I appeared to be interrupting something when I walked up. I then asked the female bartender how much the well drinks were and she said $5 as if she was already annoyed with me. I then asked her what a buckshot was (since that was the $1 special on the board.) She didn't have a straight answer and instead asked the male bartender, ""it's uh whatever we feel like making, we'll start with whiskey?"" 

I ordered it, what the hell, YOLO. Big mistake--the ""buckshot"" tasted like cough medicine and corn syrup. 

Before my order was complete the male and female bartender are snickering with each other as if they are sharing their own private joke. I seriously felt like I was transported back to middle school--who does that? I got the feeling that these two weren't happy with the crowd nor the band--but that shouldn't really matter. The crowd was there drinking (and tipping) these two because of the band. Why the attitude? 

Before the band's set was over the male bartender starts cleaning up the venue, pushing chairs in (loudly) and collecting glasses from tables. The lead singer says into the microphone ""are we being kicked out?"" to which she gets no response. The male bartender and female bartender appeared to be flirting with one another in the back corner, laughing at customers, etc. I definitely wasn't the only one that was feeling uncomfortable. These two bartenders were not only chasing the crowd away but also the headlining band. 

The venue itself had a cool vibe (aside from the nu-metal blaring in between sets), the prices were slightly more than average ($5 for a draft beer, $5 for a well drink, $1 for a ""buckshot"") and the service, well the service was non-existence. I felt like the duo was put out by my presence. Word of advice if you are the duo reading this--if your income is highly dependent upon tips, you should probably be nicer to the 20 or so people that are actually in your bar on a Monday night instead of driving them (and the band they came to see) away.","DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA",2,"2014-04-08",0,"review",0

Short Review: We were completely ignored, waited forever to get our food order taken and I had to take up my soda to the bar to get a refill.

Long Review: We were planning on going out to eat before getting to The Western, but after hitting traffic we thought we'd play it safe and just eat at the venue. We had never been, so when we arrived at 7:00 we thought the doors would be open to serve food, but when they say doors open and 7:30, they open at 7:30. As we were waiting outside, 7:30 rolled around and we were told the doors would be opening at 7:45 instead. Okay, fine, we were hungry but we could wait. 7:45, doors didn't open. 8:00, doors didn't open. Finally around 8:15, 15 minutes after the show was suppose to start we got in and we grabbed one of the first tables we saw, right at the front near the stage. 

We sat down and were handed menus pretty quickly. A waitress came around and asked if we'd been helped, we said no and ordered a Coke (which was 90% ice) and PBR. We then mentioned that we'd be ordering food tonight. Then about a minute later another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said yes and assumed they a communication or organizational issue. About 5 minutes later a bartender brought over our drinks and we started noticing food being brought out to the booths behind us. We overheard the people behind us get asked if they wanted food to eat twice, yet our waitress walked right by us. We tried several times to flag someone down, but the opening band had already begun to play so it was difficult to get anyone's attention. 

After being ready for 15 minutes, and watching everyone else get their food orders, our waitress came back and we finally got our order in. I don't remember the specifics but we got the grilled cheese and a burger. We got our food about 5 minutes later, which was okay, nothing special. At that point we were so hungry would have been happy if they just brought us over some Taco Bell. About halfway through the meal, we both ran out of drinks, down to the last drop of watered down Coke. We began another round of find your waitress as our food got cold. And once again she walked past a few times. After about 5 minutes of trying I just gave up and walked over to the end of the bar with my empty glass. Our waitress walked over to the bar and since the bartender was busy I asked her for another Coke and PBR. She replied with a cheery, ""Sure! I'll bring that right over!"" I guess she didn't find it strange that I was trying to get my own refill. She brought over our drinks and we finished our meal. Then the fastest service we got was her bringing us the bill. 

Maybe we picked a bad table. Maybe we picked a hectic night. All I know is I may be back to see a show, but I definitely will be eating somewhere else beforehand.","DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA",2,"2014-03-12",0,"review",0

I guess they were closing the books or whatever - so I got in free. SCORE! So I headed to the stage area to watch the band and boy what a cluster. Place was already packed to the gills with folks and there wasn't a whole lot of room to expand outward since there are mostly tables once you pass the main floorspace. Sound was decent - it was just a duo with no drumkit so that would have been hard to mess up. Can't complain because I didn't pay a cent for the whole experience and didn't even bother to get a drink. Managed to skip the openers and see just what I wanted. Not a bad venue but it probably works best for local acts with a smaller audience given the small space.

It's really the anti- Dierks Bentely's Whiskey Row: you'll find a more mature, well-behaved crowd and a more mellow environment more conducive to having fun than seeing and being seen.

This is equally good to come for drinks and eats as it is for drinking and tearing up the dance floor so I am looking forward to coming back soon and getting my two-step on","DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA",4,"2013-10-15",2,"review",1

Why is this place so awesome?

1. I actually met the grill master THAT GRILLED MY FOOD!  I met the man behind the delicious-ness that was my meal; he is amazing.
2. The staff/bartenders are cool.as.shit.  Seriously, they work in old town Scottsdale AND they are nice / pleasant / outgoing / cordial / amazing.  Do you know how hard that is to find in Old Town Scottsdale? 
3. They were really nice to my mom.... That gets kudos in my book.
4. All of the food was super fantastic - from the salmon to the all-your-fat-ass-can-eat-Sunday-special (which I got); it was all ahhh-mazing!  My mom literally ate her entire salmon fillet, rice pilaf, corn husk, and licked the plate so hard I think she bore a hole in it.  I ate the pork butt sliders + coleslaw + ribs + chicken + yes = happy Siobhan. 
5. I randomly found this place through Groupon and I am very pleasantly surprised.  :) 
6. They have a sweet happy hour from 5pm to 7pm....half off appetizers + cheap drinks.... Will you marry me Mr. Western?

In conclusion, this is a newer place with live music, awesome food, and even better staff.  So.... Sweet mother mary of jesus, YES, YES, YES!

Being a student lounge food and drink is very reasonably priced.  The food is generally pretty good albeit the portions can be a little on the small side.  I guess there has to be a tradeoff somewhere though.  You can expect your typical bar food (pizza, sandwiches, etc) here.

The location is its downfall.  It is north of Docteur Penfield on McTavish so it is quite the trek to get here.  In colder weather this can be unpleasant.

The staff were extremely friendly, and a woman who worked there assured me there'd be a change of menu by the following week if she could be bothered! I appreciate the numerous specials boards outside the cafe, as the food changes quite often and doesn't start to bore the customers.

They've got a clever lay out, as they offer ciabatas, baked potatoes, baguettes, wraps and rolls which can be finished off with any fillings you choose yourself from the counter! The baked potato with chicken filling I had was really good, and to top it off, they are quite cheap as well.","7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw",4,"2010-07-17",0,"review",0

My husband and I had been concerned about our car for the last 2 years since we discovered there was heavy sludging in the engine. Every quote we received to replace the engine was expensive and we didn't trust any of the mechanics we spoke with so we just kept putting off the decision.

Last month, however, things got much worse and we knew we couldn't put off the decision any longer. After trying again in vain to find a mechanic we could trust not to rip us off, my husband's friend told him about Dave and Nippon Auto Works. After talking to Dave in detail we finally felt confident we had finally found a quality mechanic we could actually trust.

I've never met a more sincere, honest, and hard working person in my life. My husband and I share one car, so Dave quickly arranged to get a replacement engine out of L.A. the same week (and not just any engine, but a high-quality replacement engine from Japan). He personally drove down to pick it up and then spent the entire weekend, when he is normally closed, to get the new engine installed. Nippon Auto Works is a small shop and Dave does all of the repairs himself, so we actually felt really bad that our single car situation meant Dave had to completely change his schedule to help us. No other mechanic would have done this for us but Dave was genuinely concerned that we would have to pay for an extended car rental so he went above and beyond to help us out in our difficult situation. 

The car is driving great now and we saved a ton of money by replacing the engine instead of buying a new car. Dave even replaced two belts, a hose, and the spark plugs, when he changed out the engine, and all total it still came out to less than what other mechanics quoted us just to replace the engine.

We feel blessed to have found Dave and we'll never bring our car to anyone else. It's so refreshing to meet someone that is passionate about what they do and truly cares about their customers. Thanks again Dave you're the best!","2RpBF5iTKmwxQ29IuaSSNg",5,"2016-07-23",1,"review",1

I made it earlier and he took my car right inside, immediately, and did the oil change. Once there, I decided to check out the other Yelp reviews and was so happy that they confirmed my first impressions. I told him that I don't live locally but that my daughter does and she doesn't have a mechanic. He gave me a punch out card where I can buy 4 oil changes and get the 5th free. And, the price of the oil changes are $19.99. He punched the card for me and told me I could give it to my daughter. That was so nice of him ;) I told him that I will have my daughter bring her car to him. I'm so glad this works out.

I spent several hours over several days looking for an American made Teddy Bear for my grandson. Of the five companies I called, all claimed their bear was made in the USA were stretching the truth in that the bear was made in the USA but after calling the company, I find that the materials are made in another country (mainly China) and assembled in the USA.  Stuffington was the ONLY company I found where the entire bear is made in America by them. I feel it's deceptive by the other companies using the word ""made"" when they should be using the word ""assembled"". Also, we wanted the eyes to be replaced and have sewn eyes and no ribbon which they did at no extra charge.

I loved that the bears are built in the USA and it is a local business. The tour was fun. I set it up with my meet-up group and 12 moms and 15 kids attended, most kids were 5 or younger. We first sat in a room and were given a cool Q&A session and lesson on how the Teddy Bear was invented, and then we walked the production floor and saw how the bears were made.

À la base, donc, on ne peut pas dire que je suis fan de ce genre d'endroit... Néanmoins, si on devait éliminer 90% de ce genre de restaurant, je pense que je voudrait que la grand-mère poule demeure.  Pourquoi ?  D'abord parce qu'il y a au moins moyen, chez eux, de manger autre chose que les éternels oeufs-crêpe-pain dorés.  J'aime beaucoup, personnellement, les röstis, galettes de pommes de terre rapées, agrémentées de fromage, d'olive, de tomate, de bacon, ou autre selon celle que l'on choisit.  Ils font aussi d'excellentes pancakes à l'avoine.  Les portions sont généreuses et les prix très convenables.

Pourquoi pas une étoile de plus alors ?

Parce qu'ils ne savent pas faire un expresso convenable (et c'est vraiment le MOINS qu'on puisse dire).  Évitez tout ce qui ressemble à un expresso, cappucino, café au lait  en cet endroit (en tous cas, si vous aimez le café).  À titre d'exemple, quand j'ai commandé un expresso double très très court, on m'a apporté une bonne demi-tasse d'eau de vaisselle.  On m'a expliqué que c'était le plus court que la machine pouvait faire...  Merde, c'est au moins 8 fois trop d'eau!  Changez de machine!
Leur filtre, quoique manquant un peu de concentration, est bon à sa façon.  Vaut mieux s'en tenir à ça...

Weak points:

- No vegetarian option for main dishes. Vegetarian entrées were available and I was told that the burrito's meat/chicken could be swapped for grilled vegetables at the same price. Weak. Also, grilled vegetables are not a proper vegetarian choice in 2015, especially in a restaurant that features beans and cheese in so many other dishes.
- The booze situation. Every table outdoors is adorned with a centerpiece of three beers (not included, just to be clear). The first two pages of the food menu are actually a drink menu. When we were ready to order, with closed menus, our waitress reopened my menu to the drink pages and went on at great length about what was available.

After he """"realized"" he charged more. He said he thought we order one more soda. What soda worth 5 dollars? That's totally a lie.

When you can't find authentic Turkish food it's like you have no choice but to go here hoping that you'll get lucky and eat something  decent, but unfortunately you can't eat anything good here . First they don't know how to make doner , bulgur pilav is sooooo dry have absolutely no taste ,let's talk about so called Adana kebab now that's a total joke it's just a minced meat filled with cheap quality red pepper to make it spicy and hoping that it becomes what is supposed to be but unfortunately it does not work that way , Now is the restaurant busy ? Ya kind of but with what kind of customers? Definitely majority of there customers don't have Turkish or let's say Armenian backgrounds , they cater to low budget middle eastern immigrants most of them from 3rd world country's where they don't have any idea what Turkish food is . 
People who reads our reviews will see that so far we don't have 1 good review about Turkish restaurants in Ontario and Quebec , that's because we travel to Istanbul 4 to 6 times a year and we really know what Turkish kebab is  unfortunately there is not one decent Turkish kebab restaurant specially in Quebec .
Place looks like a old Middleastern mosque with all green walls , and the music that you hear while you eat? Omg in Turkish we say (AGIT) meaning? Sad crying song when someone dies this is the kind of music they listen at uncivilized Turkish villages. Before I forget Shepard salad , ezme are sitting on the counter( not in the fridge) yes on the counter covered with Saran Wrap so it does not get dirty , you have to eat warm Shepard salad that's unfortunate :))))) 
Is the place clean yes it is but then again that does not make the food good, 
Iam hoping 1 day In Montreal we will have a good Turkish kebab restaurants like Toronto or New York but I have no hopes ,why I don't have hopes?  Because who wants to invest in Montreal ? They rather go to Toronto Vancouver etc where they don't have to put up with tax or French bs.

And believe me it is not a busy restaurant. Although one can quip about their mediocre decor or lack thereof, I can only talk positive about the bread they use which is ok, not too fluffy and slightly crispy after it's grilled.

My love for cooking and food often drives me to search out the best wares and items to create that perfect dish.  When Williams Sonoma came to Canada, I was thrilled but the price mark up kept me away from the store for the first few years.  Fast forward to today and I'm still weary of paying the Canadian retail price but the service and noted constant sales is slowly winning me over.

The store is right at the corridor leading to Holt Renfrew and right across from Tiffany's.  With it's golden accented and deep blonde wood doors, the waft of spiced apple cider pulls me in.  They have a full working kitchen inside the store and one of their cleaver ploys is having a constant baked or bubbling item going at all times.  During Thanksgiving it's their pumpkin butter bars and now it's their peppermint bark and spiced cider.  

For the epicurean, this place is potentially nirvana (if it was all free).  You'll find only the best (and most expensive) pieces to adorn your kitchen and dining room.  Heavy copper pots, high end espresso machines, singular grain Japanese knives, hard to find herbs and spices, bakeware, and china fills the room in all corners.  The associates free float and are super helpful to find the perfect utensil or item of your kitchen dreams.  

They have many high end brands like Le Creuset, All Clad,  WMF, and Kikuichi. It can be really daunting at first to pick up one item and see it being $300+.  The nice thing is that there are some (relatively) affordable alternatives nearby and the associates are more than happy to explain which one would be best for you.  If you're lucky, you may find one of those ridiculously high end items in their clearance section at a good 50% off. I managed to pick an All Clad saucier that way and I still love it do date.

The store is open, spacious, and well stocked.  There is never an issue with service as they are so efficient in finding you a brand new boxed item and running it through the cashier till in minutes.  Though it is a very expensive store, the quality of the items and service does make it feel special.  Now... if they stop that horrid Canadian mark up, this would be a perfect 4 star store.","4CtO9NSXi9MCgYsPZBdN8w",3,"2012-11-29",0,"review",0
"1809",0,"m9090whCBqsusfgCzf0uMg","-iJ5FxFFoacsceGuK0cHvg","What a terrible shopping experience I had there today.  Friends had bought my wife and I a wedding gift, a gift card from Williams-Sonoma.  Firstly the web site wouldn't allow us to redeem it (even though they say all over the site that you can, apparently it only applies to US shoppers and not Canadians).  So into the store I trekked with my list of 3 things that I couldn't buy from the site with the gift card.  Sounds simple enough, right? 

On arrival I was asked if I needed help, and I said yes and informed the sales woman that I had a list of specific items that I was looking for and that it even had the item numbers/SKUs.  She sounded very surprised but didn't want the list I had printed that though would make life much easier, she wanted the items by name ... but only one at a time.  Sooooo it all started.  After 20+ minutes of waiting around and them fumbling through their inventory software they ""found"" the first item I was looking for in the back ... the computer told them they had 4 in stock but they were all scratching their heads as to where they would be.   The sales woman brought me 3 of the 4 of them they had, apparently so I could ""look"" at the different ones and decide which I wanted (this was a boxed up pair of knives in a gift set).  I thought it a bit strange but picked up the first box, opened it up and said ""Yes, this is what I want.""

After scanning in this first item the price was a good bit more than it was on the website.  I asked about this and was told in a very brusk manner by the store manager (who had taken over at this point, apparently it was too much for the other employee to handle) that there was no way they could ""match"" the price advertised on their website, and that the price that I had on my list must be in US dollars.  It was not.  It took her about 10 minutes of clicking all around the website to concede that the price I showed her was indeed in Canadian dollars.

She then proceeded to tell me that she still couldn't match the price because ""of course you still have to pay duty on that price"" ... and the answer was no, you do not, all the prices they show on the site include all applicable duty (this is in bold in 18 point font at the top of the page which was currently open on her computer and I pointed this out to her).  Then she proceeds to tell me ""Oh look, see this?  There's a flat rate $10 shipping charge on any items so I still can't price match that price because you have to pay shipping"" ... I proceeded to ask her ""So you're telling me that I have to pay a $10 shipping fee even though I'm here in the store to pick the item up?!??"" ...

The arguing went along for a few more minutes with her giving me even more excuses why she couldn't possibly match the price on the website until I pulled out my phone and actually read her the statement on the website that stated that all advertised prices were valid in any Williams-Sonoma retail store.  She still wasn't budging, so I asked to speak to her supervisor.  When she told me that she was the store manager and didn't have a supervisor, so I then asked her to call up her head office and have THEM explain to ME why I had been standing here wasting time for over half of an hour and that it was ok for her to charge me more than the advertised price for the item in question.  She finally relented and insisted on looking at the US price for the item and then using today's exchange rate in order to ""fix"" the price on my item -- so it turned out to be $0.61 more expensive than the website price.  Luckily while all of this waiting around was happening I found the other couple of items that were on my list by myself and they didn't need price adjustments.

All-in-all one of the worst shopping experiences I've had in a long, long time.  I will likely never set foot in that store again.  If it had not been for the gift card that I had no choice but to redeem in their brick and mortar store I would have walked out without making the purchase.","4CtO9NSXi9MCgYsPZBdN8w",1,"2013-05-13",0,"review",0

My husband and I have both shopped together and on separate occasions and always leave feeling like we've interrupted or inconvenienced the sales associates by shopping and purchasing. On one occasion, the sales associate was so preoccupied with removing staples from a table cloth, she told an elderly couple the item they were looking for was 'just up at the front of the store' while pointing and letting them go off on their own to find it.  
Neither of us have ever been greeted upon entering the store or been asked if we'd like assistance. To be helped, I find I always have to wait at the cash desk until someone appears from the back or looks up from their merchandising to acknowledge me. 
On the other hand, the products are great, and we're excited to redeem the very generous gift card we received as a wedding gift but I think we'll head to another location to use it.","4CtO9NSXi9MCgYsPZBdN8w",2,"2016-02-01",0,"review",0

First impressions; it looks pretty fancy inside, kinda shiny, and the waiters and waitresses use littler ipad things to take your order. I almost felt like I didn't belong. But they were quite friendly, I guess they should be since it was only us and one or 2 people getting take out.

CONS:
- No dessert on the AYCE menu.  
- Dim sum items weren't that great - its like they needed more salt.  Kind of bland.

NEUTRAL/OTHER OBSERVATIONS:
- Didn't have the wonton soup when I ordered it, so I went for Hot & Sour instead.
- The food here is kind of like Manchu Wok/Szechuan-Szechuan type food, with the addition of Sushi though

1. Decor is modern and appears fairly clean. 

Cons:

1. Very slow and incompetent service, despite being one of the only families at the restaurant. They kept getting our order wrong and bringing out duplicate dishes. An hour in to dinner we still did not receive our sushi and had to place our order again

The food is very bland!  Any request for spicy food results in them tossing in chili flakes.  At Salad King they use fresh peppers!  When I was in Thailand, they use fresh peppers.  The peppers should be infused in the meal!!!

Service?  I have only gone through take out, 3 times.  My last experience was super bad.  I had to go back and forth from my office to the restaurant since they messed up my order twice.  THREE trips to that location for 1 order is unacceptable.

The restaurants were a lot fewer back then so going out to eat was a big deal.  My memories of it when being a child were all of people that I was with, and not the food, and now I think I know why...  If the food was as bland back then as it is now, it is completely forget-able.  

I have dined at this Country Kitchen on several occaisions after movies at the UltraStar Theater (they should drop the Ultra...)  and I have brought my family here several times for breakfast or quick lunches etc.  It will do in a pinch, but I have yet to be really wowed and I am pretty sure I will not be.

Country Kitchen is a lateral move from Dennys and IHOP, with a slightly better focus on service however given the area I know that service will be the first thing to go.  The area of the restaurant and indeed the area where I live is plagued by the economy.  We are a neighborhood of the haves and the have-nots.  When the have-nots barely speak english and disrepect the community it shows and it takes it's toll on the service people.  But I digress...back to the Country Kitchen.

It is a bit pricey for what you get but there are lots of coupons out there including some from their own web site.  So if you must eat here, bring a coupon or the bill will somewhat infuriate you due to the wholly unexceptional food.  Without a coupon expect to pay 15-20% more than a Dennys or Village Inn for about the same food.

On the bright side, I have had lunch here several times and really enjoyed the Reuben, so there is at least one sandwich that has some flavor and was not a dissapointment.  So there we have it, if you are dragged here to eat, get a Reuben.  : )

the other night we got back from happy hour and appetizers with some coworkers of mine and we were still hungry, not feeling like fast food we call up country kitchen and order an order of their sliders and 2 milkshakes. they don't give us an eta or a total on the phone.

so I wait about 10-15 minutes, leave my house which is about 2 mi away, arrive at the restaurant to find it completely barren at about 7:30PM, I approach the counter and the manager just continues to mess with his blackberry never looking up eventually, a hostess comes from the back and greets me, mind you it's already been 15 minutes and all they need to do was grill some small beef pattys and drop some fries, I still end up waiting another 10 minutes for my food, only to have everyone disappear into the back of the restaurant again to have another server come out confused and try to seat me. eventually I get the food, the sliders aren't bad, but there's only 3, WTF it's an unwritten rule that sliders come in even numbers, I don't know if it's just me, or working in a White Castle as a teen, but 3 sliders could potentially cause a rift in some relationships, 

the decor is an orgy of applebees, IHOP and denny's but imagine if you arrived  at the ""campy wall crap"" store only to find they'd already been cleaned out by an applebees corporate decorator, the decorations range from giant utensils, wireframe art, sports posters and scenic views.  I'm really not sure which direction they were trying to go.

My original plan was to quickly show her First Friday, figuring that the summer night heat and gangs of teenage hippies roaming around would cause her to want to leave after a brief glimpse. I then planned on meeting up with friends at The Roosevelt after dropping her off. Instead, she (herself a watercolor artist) was captivated by some of the interesting art we found in various galleries on Grand Ave, followed by Red Dog on 3rd Street and the street displays. Then, as I watched the time creep up to ten p.m., she became mesmerized by a punk rock band playing on the corner of 4th and Roosevelt. ""So Mom, you want to go home yet?"" I asked at one point. ""No way. I love this music! What is this band called?"" I thought I was in the Twilight Zone. And that was before some guy asked her as she walked by whether she liked Tupac. 

Eventually she got her fill of hippy art and punk rock and I joined my friends at the way-too-packed Roosevelt. The point is that First Friday is the kind of place you can even bring your mom to.","GEVK0qDkoCSF2oTaHv9nJg",5,"2007-08-07",4,"review",4

To be honest, the best thing was that I discovered some really cool restaurants and bars in the neighborhood.  You would never know them because they are in actual homes.  The bars primarily served beer and wine, but had lots of artwork,  and were a bit swanky.... I like it!","GEVK0qDkoCSF2oTaHv9nJg",5,"2007-07-12",4,"review",4

I used to hit First Fridays every once in a while because I liked it, but couldn't deal with all of the random junk people were selling along Roosevelt. Now, not only do I love First Fridays, but I've been a vendor at each one since June and will continue to be. 

They have created a great environment for the crowd and cleaned up the vending so it's actually fun to cruise through. It's the most culture you'll find in the Valley in one night and there's something different each month. It's a great excuse to explore a part of the city that's really coming around and support local businesses at the same time. 

Next time you go to First Fridays, stop by the Durtbagz booth and say ""hi""!

Sorry folks, First Fridays is not for me. I went last week hoping to discover an exciting new aspect of the Valley's cultural ascendance but I left feeling totally bummed. The whole scene felt like a sort of bizarro reverse Scottsdale Fashion Square counterculture. Like day vs night, conformists vs non-conformists, capitalists vs social anarchists.  I felt like I was engulfed by people trying so hard not to fit in that they somehow managed to become clones of themselves. And you know what sucks about the whole thing?... I'll bet there are dozens of extremely talented young artists whose work is completely overwhelmed by sheer sensual overload of this spectacle. A perfect example would be this fantastically talented young girl singing and playing guitar. She couldn't be more than 16 years old. Great voice. About 35 feet away there was loud punk rock band jamming away completely drowning out our fresh faced heroine. Or, was it the opposite? Maybe I was the one who was wrong and it was my youthful singer whose little amplifier managed to get in the way of an even more talented band, maybe Phoenix's version of Social Distortion or the Misfits? Either way, I was totally disoriented....... and bummed.  

I felt the same way about the conventional art on display. I made a concerted effort to find unique works, possibly a piece that really resonated with me that I would want to see on a wall in my home. Instead 90% of what I saw there reminded me of the doodles and art class projects that my friends and I used to create when our lives were devoted to playing Dungeons and Dragons and watching Hellraiser marathons on VHS.  

On a side note, is it just me or do young people who devote their lives to blood, gore, pain and suffering annoy anyone else? If these kids think life sucks now I can't wait to see them after they end up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans only to realize that their newfound reality will be years and years of toiling away in the friendly confines of a 6 square foot gray cubicle. And compared to many third word citizens this new reality would be considered paradise. It's that lack of perspective that I have a hard time accepting. But we all go through our phases and I wish them the best of luck. 

Trust me, I feel horrible that I have to write a negative review. I know there is some really great stuff out there. I just couldn't find it. It didn't take me long to simply give up and start drinking. Fortunately we found a cool little place to drown our sorrows called ""Lost Leaf"" which turned out to be one of the highlights of my evening. 

The only way I would go back is if someone convinces me that they can show me all the hidden gems at First Friday buried amongst the dark alleys and dusty, vacant lots. If that happens I would be glad to revise my review and formally apologize for not having the patience to discover these cultural treasures on my own. 

And before you rip me apart for not having the ability to see the true beauty of this event please understand that I have read Chomsky, Zinn, Hitchens etc...I spent much of my youth hobnobbing with homeless buskers at The Pearl Street Mall in Boulder. I studied Marx and Engels in college and I have spent entire days soaking it all in at the Pompidou and Musee d'Orsay. And to top it off, I hand wrote ""Nader"" on my presidential ballot once, and might do it again someday. So spare me the tired accusations of xenophobia and intolerance. BTW...Go Buffs!","GEVK0qDkoCSF2oTaHv9nJg",2,"2011-04-04",4,"review",2

Though First Fridays have become absolutely huge now, and it hardly feels the same - I actually love hanging with the crowds once a year for Art Detour.

Once a year more galleries open, and lots of businesses will display art instead of just Friday night it's Friday, that Saturday and Sunday!  I've brought new people with me every year and no one is ever disappointed.  Some folks like to drive from one spot to the next and that definitely has it's advantages!  It's also fun to take the shuttle around.  You can have some fun conversations, find out the skinny on a particular gallery, or get hot spot info from the bus drivers.  And while both First Friday and Art Link are definitely All-age events, there are generally several after parties for the over 21 crowd sponsored by individual locations.

Art link has some great volunteer opportunities too, and it can be a great way for someone new to town to get to know people while learning all about the downtown art scene.","GEVK0qDkoCSF2oTaHv9nJg",5,"2007-02-28",3,"review",2

It didn't exactly grab me as a place to take a baby to...whole bunch of crazy partying artists for an excuse...just kidding.  I finally went along with my hubby and 5 year old son about 5 months ago for the first time and have gone to several since then.  We absolutely loved it!  We parked around Tammie Coe's Bakery (that's how we came to visit this joint so often) and order some coffee and dessert while we walked around.

Artlink definitely revived what was once a seedy part of downtown into something so unique to Phoenicians.  Old and dilapidated bungalows were transformed into jewelry, pottery, and sculpture enclaves.  Headlining local bands performing in front yards...so cool!  It's brilliant to take a small apartment complex in a state of disrepair into single room artist galleries.  My son was mesmerized by a couple of beautiful women with their flame throwing act while a bonfire ablazed behind them.  That's the only time he stood still.  

I told my artist friends how much I enjoy First Fridays. They told me ""It's not the same as it used to be.  It's so crowded now when it was once just a whole bunch of artists getting together.""

I like to credit Artlink with single-handedly improving the vibrancy of Downtown Phoenix with its First Friday Artwalk.  It's one of my favorite pasttimes about living in Phoenix and is a true testament to the cultural destination our area has become.

I had no idea where to park since I wasn't sure what I even wanted to do other than eat at the food trucks which are located between 3rd and 5th street on Roosevelt. I ended up parking in the Phoenix Public Market lot. I got there around 8pm and luckily found a spot. Walking the streets (no, I'm not a hooker) was a bit overwhelming. There was a mix of people on the streets, but I will say that I felt like I stood out like a sore thumb.. I guess I'm on the preppy side. Popular trends were skinny jeans, cloves and bohemian folk. We basically just walked where there was crowds because there was something to see everywhere. There is so much going on with street performers, art/jewelry sellers, art galleries, that I don't feel like I even came close to fully experiencing First Friday. I was happy that I got to try some food truck goodies (bacon ice cream from Sweet Republic; banana rumballs, stuffed jalapenos, bombay fries w cucumber dipping sauce from Sunshine & Spice; portabella tacos from Carte Blanc). I'm looking forward to checking out First Friday again.. so four stars since it reeled me in!

First, her husband takes your credit card number in order to make an initial appointment, ""Just in case you don't show up."" Nothing like ""give me access to your bank account"" to make me feel safe.

In that initial call when he takes your financial information, there is no warning that the ""counseling"" office (and I use that term loosely) has animals in it. Only when she guides you to the room does she flippantly ask, ""You're not allergic to cats are you?"" No, and good thing I don't hate them, or the nappy dog that greeted me too. 

The ""counseling"" room is disgusting. Couches are covered in cat hair, ceiling tiles with old water stains, an imposing fish tank that is not calming an any way. The chair in which she sits is nowhere near the couch where my husband and I sat, so it was great feeling as though she had no interest in any intimacy or sitting anywhere near us. And I could barely hear her.

She began dropping F-bombs almost immediately, and rolled her eyes at any other attempts at therapy we had made before. She doesn't listen, at all. Repeatedly asked us the same questions and simply didn't hear us. I had to educate her on Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and she ignorantly informed me that I HAD to go through certain steps in grief. Ummmm, I don't ""have"" to do anything.

Her speech was slurred and incoherent and it often appeared she would fall asleep at any moment.

My husband was digging his fingers into my leg for two reasons: to keep me from fleeing and because he couldn't believe we were paying this woman $125.

I repeat, go ANYWHERE else.","-DPq2CaW-mBYZ3hfed4pxw",1,"2015-08-30",5,"review",2

I recently needed a prescription refilled. According to the last conversation I had w/ my therapist (whom I adore, pity she is associated with this place), she indicated I would not need a return visit - unless I needed to see her, our sessions were wrapped up and the prescription would continue.

I requested a refill via my pharmacy on Monday 3/17, which was 'authorization required', and the pharmacy sent the request to DV Counseling the same day. I needed to get this refilled prior to Thurs. 3/20 because I was going out of town on 3/21. When I hadn't heard anything by the 20th, I followed up with their office THREE TIMES that day - morning, mid day, mid afternoon, and let them know of the urgency.  On 3/24, I still had not received a call back or a prescription refill, so I called to inquire again and left yet another message. And again after no call back, left another message on 3/28. 

Yet again on 3/29 left another message, and left a generic voicemail that I needed to speak with the manager or owner that day.  That was the ONLY call back I ever got.  In that conversation with the manger, after describing my situation, I was told:  ""It is actually not legal..... er, um.... it's not ethical for (my therapist) to authorize a refill without seeing you"". I suggested that he call my therapist to see what the status of my visits were, which I explained, according to my last conversation w/ my therapist were not necessary, and to please call me back later that day after he had spoken with her. Didn't get a call back. 

I called again on 4/4 to ask that my therapist call me directly.  I have to presume that message was never even given to her, because again, no one called.

Wouldn't you know..... I am still waiting for ANYONE - ANYONE to call me back as of today, 4/8.  Boy, I sure would have liked to have addressed this with them directly, but it appears absolutely nobody is going to pick up the phone and call me - after I left EIGHT MESSAGES over a span of two weeks. 

Good to know that my mental health isn't really that important to them - and also seems like a good thing that I don't really NEED that prescription or anything! 

What a shame, because I really REALLY loved my therapist, and previously happily paid out of pocket to see her because she is THAT good. However, after this pathetic absolute lack of communication or customer service, this place doesn't deserve my cash ($180 an hour!) or my business.

But if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch....apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal.

Stopped in this junction of the galaxy last night with three friends after spending all day moving my Captain's Quarters.  I was sporting my skimpy blue retro work-out shorts with white trim, as I was tired and wasn't in the mood to even change.  I garnered a few odd glances (such to be expected) but we were quickly seated.  I tend not to do buffets now, as I'm really trying to watch my weight, but this place was recommended to me by my Lieutenant.  I'll be beating him later, but I digress.  

The food was pretty marginal overall.  It was definitely NOT hot enough.  Replicator food on the Enterprise is better than this.  Want to piss me off?  Serve me tepid food and then charge me $8 cubits a head for same.  Some items were better than others.  I almost think there were too many choices.  I'd like to see the choices narrowed, the temperature increased and the food quality improved.  

As for eating sushi in a place like this?  No way in Hades.  Not last night, not today and certainly not tomorrow.  I'd rather chase Khan with a crippled ship in a nebula before I dine here again.

Overall, C-

There has to be better choices for buffet Chinese food in central Phoenix, and I'm on a mission to find it.  ""Engage long range scanners, Mr. Sulu.  We must find a suitable class-M Chinese food planet in this sector.""  :D

Keep in mind the people seating you barely speak English. There's always a language barrier. They're really only there to clear plates away.

Their quality can waver, probably as much by time spent on the steam tables as any other reason.

Their fried shrimp, hot and sour soup are generally very good. Most everything is in the typical range. They always have poached salmon but the steam table is capable of making it uneditable but when not destroyed on the steam table, it's generally quite good.

Friend said that their sushi was decent but I this doesn't strike me as a place to eat sushi.

Evenings and weekends are priced higher but they generally have crab legs and beef ribs.

Staff is generally friendly and attentive.","8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA",3,"2009-01-07",3,"review",2

Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought ""why not Chinese?""  I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.

Being greeted on the way in with a ""You are on camera"" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.

But then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.

The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the ""orange chicken"" from the ""sesame chicken"" from the ""pepper chicken"" by any sense other than sight.

The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).

The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.

They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.

Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.

I won't be back, unless I'm told they're under new management.","8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA",1,"2011-06-16",0,"review",0

The open air area was a complete hot box, very humid to the point that people were sticking to the booths. Hostess then left, didn't leave menus, beer lists, nothing! Server arrived and could tell we were annoyed, we informed her that it was our first time there, we were just rushed in, and wanted to switch to the other side.

We went in to Oakmont to spend our money ($160 on the evening) I guess Brewstone didn't care for me to spend my money there.

I was a member of their Mug Club from the moment they started it, and I miss it horribly. So naturally I was very disappointed that the brewing equipment is gone. Don't let the name fool you, Brewstone Beerhouse is not a brew pub. However they do have a fairly good list of craft beer available, as well as the regular cra*.  The service was very good. Our waiter, Lindley (?) was very nice and attentive, extremely helpful as was the bartender in the back bar. The food was good, I had a burger (cooked perfectly, very tasty) It was a little loud, there was a live musician playing by the patio area, but in the back by the restrooms the place was much quieter.

There are a large number of beers, but as far as I know, none are brewed by Brewstone.  There is a large bar and huge seating area that seemed like sports bar meets high class lounge.  Booths each had their own individual TVs (along with several TVs on the walls) but there are also fireplaces and other items that didn't seem to go with the individual TVs.

The menu is equally as mixed.  There are traditional bar favorites, but then there were some ""fancy"" things as well.

The nacho appetizer is HUGE.  The two of us could have eaten it and not had an entree and still been full.  It was tasty, but they should consider cutting the portion and the price.  Or at least having a half order option.

The corn chowder is amazing.  I loved the taste and texture and was disappointed when it was gone.

The burger, sliders and pasta were all OK, but nothing remarkable.

Restaurant: L shaped setup. Two bars full bars, one indoor and one indoor/outdoor. The indoor bar is in between the main entrance and the dining room. The indoor/outdoor is to the left of the entrance away from the rest of the restaurant. The indoor/outdoor bar has booths with personal TV's, an ""O"" shaped bar with plenty of big screen TV's, and roll up doors which are open on nice nights leading to the outdoor patio. The place is very nice and clean. Very nice look and upkeep

Drink: Great beer selection. They have a long list of beer on tap which includes your normal domestics, seasonal beers, and micro brews. Most places do not have this selection which is amazing for people who enjoy this type of selection. PLUS, they have a two full bars for people who love liquor. 

Food: Food has changed since the name has changed and the business is under new management. The menu is similar but not quiet the same and they have rid the menu of many of the items that I liked. They have a good variety consisting of steak, chicken, sea food, burgers, and homemade pizzas. Overall the food is decent but not as good as it used to be. 

Atmosphere: Great overall. Dining room and inside bar are a good casual family area. The Indoor/Outdoor bar is separate and has more of a casual bar feel to it. Great place for any occasion and for sports games. 

Staff: Overall they are not bad but they are certainly not great either. Some of the waiters/waitresses are good and some not so much. All of them are friendly however some seem very new while others are veterans in the food service. The service is very inconsistent. More consistency would go a long way. 

Overall: Good but not great. I miss the Indoor/Outdoor bar being open more often. It really gave the place a different dimension and a more causal relaxing feel that nowhere else really offers during nice days. I also miss the homemade dressings, specialty pizzas, BBQ sauce, and custom burgers. Sure they offer these things but they are not the same as before. I like the place and will go there occasionally but not as much as before.

We stopped in last night for dinner and were very impressed.  As mentioned in another review, the place is spotless. They invested some serious cash in converting the decor from what used to be a dimly lit John Harvards location.   Two bars seems odd however but both were relatively busy. 

I went with the fish and chips as it's my baseline for what any bar/pub should get right without worry. It was a bit light on fish and heavy on fries but both were good, so I can't really complain for the price. Better half had the BBQ pork sliders (carolina style) and thoroughly enjoyed them. 
Mixed drink for her and draft micro for me seemed reasonably priced. 
Draft beer list was certainly bigger than I expected from earlier reviews. 

Having a TV inside every booth seemed excessive, but should go over extremely well with the sports crowd and should do wonders for BW3's prices and awful service across the street.  At least none of them had volume on. 
Wait staff seemed very attentive but this may also be because they just opened and over-compensate.

The decor... 4.5 stars.  Lots of seating options indoors and out.  Tons of TV's available for game day viewing.

The menu... 3 stars.  It's got the usual sports bar fare, but because the place looks so nice, I expected a more extensive menu that just a one page, black and white printed list of their offering.  Perhaps we got a game-time/lunch menu??

The food... 4 stars.  Among the 6 of us, we ordered 2 kids of wings (Garlic Parm & the Whiskey Bourbon), but for $10 you'd think you get more than 8 wings per serving.  Both flavors tasted pretty good; though I would have liked a little more garlic or salt on the garlic parm flavor.  We also got the nachos - pretty standard, and a variety of burgers.  Everyone enjoyed the burgers.  Very flavorful and moist.  The drinks from the bar were pretty sweet.

The service... 1 star.  Sure, it was game-time, opening weekend of the NFL season, but the place wasn't packed.  Most of the patrons were seated in either of the two bar areas.  I only saw one table in the large dining room.  So, either the placed wasn't properly staffed by management for a game-time crowd, or the service was incredible slow.  Our server was very nice and courteous even when I'm sure she could tell we were getting annoyed with repeating requests for refills on drinks long empty, or asking about the status of our food, but she kept a smile and responded politely.  

The pricepoint ... 3 stars.  The prices were about what you'd expect for bar food.  $10 for a burger, etc.

In all, while the food was pretty good and the set-up/layout of the place is nice, I think the only way I'd return is if I was truly there just to watch the game, and the drinks/snacks were an afterthought.  If I was going to hangout with friends and watch the game and wasn't going because I was hungry, then it might have been okay.","0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ",2,"2013-09-09",2,"review",0

Brewstone Beer Company was one of those dynamite experiences that just put smiles on our faces.  An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale; but offers an array of mind-blowing food!  Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect!  Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing... never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of... well - Nachos.  Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili... should I go on?  We opted for all three meats: grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving.  It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish.  LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan.  As for the steak... sweet and unbelievable!  Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date.

The Seared Ahi Tuna again blew my mind... Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds; the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic!  I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine; lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang.  Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella; but aside from the obvious... they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying!  So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure.  Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne, then topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken).  The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds.

The entrees cometh... we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich; the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect. The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow... big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter!  Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie; the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic.  I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic!  Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions... full of cheese with a killer flavor.  Beautiful, bountiful... absurdly GREAT!  Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner; but with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy!  The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and then drowned in heavenly gravy.

Our server never mentioned anything special though we said we were new too the place. We asked what was great and she said, ""Well, pizza is really good, but our pizza chef isn't in yet. Everything else is decent."" (1pm on a Sunday). Not a good sign at all. We should have known by how empty the place was. 

So, I ordered a burger, medium, that had goat cheese and bacon (server told me not to get the goat cheese because it can be ""overpowering""--another bad sign since goat cheese is quite mild, but I asked for it anyways). Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger.

Wife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side. Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated. It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing. The dressing was unbelievably strong in vinegar flavor. So strong that my wife asked to take the tuna and have them just provide new greens. One fork dip in the dressing was strong enough. $16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine.

Beer was good, but she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle. Food wasn't good. Service was, meh. In an empty restaurant, you expect servers to be accessible.

We always go twice in case it was just a fluke, but judging by other reviews, this may be a drinks-only kind of place.","0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ",1,"2012-09-08",1,"review",1

Our friends suggested ""Breakaway Bar & Grill"" or Brewstone, or whatever name they are going by. Our friends arrived before us and put our name in for the waiting list. The short women with longer black hair took the reservation and had a HORRIBLE attitude. She called our name and we gathered our belongs in hopes that we were going to be seated, she said, ""No. you aren't being seated. Just want to asks you a question."" Well. Ok? 

We finally got seated after a few minutes of confusion because obviously she had no clue what she was doing. We sat at a large high top table and waited 10 minutes before our server finally arrived to take our drink orders. Then another 5-7 before finally taking our food order. The food menu was lackluster, generic & over priced.

I ordered a burger to be cooked ""medium"" with a side of sweet potato fries and my husband ordered a pizza. When our food arrived my burger was cooked well-done, flavorless & the sweet potato fries were room temperature at best. My husband stated that his pizza was sub-par at best and was clearly frozen pizza crust instead of freshly made. Throughout the course of visit random people (I'm assuming who were management but was hard to tell from their very causal jeans and tshirt) came by to take empty plates instead of asking about our food. Our waitress was scarce so we were often left with empty glasses.

This took her a few minutes and she informed us she would have to move a table. Which she did not need to do. She did not know the specials. Then the waitress came over and told us we took some one else's table. No one sat at the table the whole time we were there. We moved closer to the fire. Then the waitress took our order, not when she originally talked to us but a few minutes later. She barely knew the specials. We ordered our drinks. The waitress brought them in a reasonable time only to spill one in front of me and the other on my leg. No big deal, but it did happen. I asked about the food specials posted, and she said they did not have any. I asked a manager as well. The cards on the table said food specials. He said there were none. Then the waitress brought the check. Our beers were full price. She told me it was the beer tax. They were $4 per beer and had two different prices after this beer tax. She fixed it after this was pointed out to her. On the way out the manager did not even ask about the evening. He did not get my opinion and will not be getting my money again.

The Brewstone interior is beautiful, with lots of wood, and a gorgeous stone double-sided fireplace. It's without a doubt a warm, welcoming environment (although I could do without so many TVs everywhere). 

I really wanted to love Brewstone. We first tried it for dinner on Sept. 19. Service was slow to the point that the manager came out to apologize. Our server was very pleasant and apologetic, and we were forgiving as it's a new place. Some of the food was good (I liked the fish tacos) and other dishes were average. 

We tried Brewstone again last night, 9/24. Service was again very slow. I can understand that the kitchen gets backed up, but I don't expect waiting 15 minutes for drinks to arrive. And when my beer arrived... there was a gnat floating in it. I didn't want to wait for our waiter to return, so I walked the beer over to the bar. The bartender replaced it with a ""sorry"" without any sincerity. 

We tried the quesadilla and pizza and both were average at best. The fries are not so great either.

I am not writ ting this just to be critical; I am hoping the management will read this and make some much needed changes.

Since the place is a Sports bar, I am going to go with that ""format""...

Strike one:  Brewstone is not a brewpub, which is what I was expecting.  The ""beer experience"" is severely lacking as the ""beer menu"" was very confusing.  Instead of telling you what beer is what, the menu and the wait staff give you a vague, general idea of what beer you are going to get, such as a ""citrusy, hoppy beer,"" (which equates to an IPA) or a ""dark, sweet beer,"" (a stout).  Being a minor beer snob, I found the process bewildering as I had to guess at what I was going to get.  They should just tell you it's a ""Stone IPA,"" or ""Founder's Breakfast Stout,"" instead of letting you ""guess.""

Strike two:  The service was less than stellar.  Again, this may have improved, but after we ordered our drinks,  the waitress said she couldn't find the bartender, so there was a delay.  Our waitress (a very young woman) seemed to really be trying, but it seemed like she wasn't trained very well.  

Strike three:  The food, again wasn't great.  I got a burger and it was so-so.  My wife was mad that she didn't even get a piece of bread with her salad.  Our 2 friends weren't impressed either.  I spoke to someone else who ate there and they really liked the food, so maybe it was what we ordered..... dunno.

Overall, we were disappointed and underwhelmed.... and we really wanted to like the place.... there aren't too many places in Monroeville that I really like.  I hope the management reads these reviews and makes so much needed improvements.","0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ",2,"2013-03-24",0,"review",0

The interior is enormous with two separate bar areas, a large dining room separated into two spaces by a dividing wall, and an outdoor patio space. The place is full of flat screen hdtv's, and will be a magnet for football fans on weekends in the fall. They have a major high-end sound system throughout the place (which was sadly playing 70's/80's pop music accompanied by videos on some of the tv's). The a/v investment is very impressive.

I have no doubt this place will be popular. The menu is full of reasonably priced classic sports bar fare like wings, nachos, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, etc. I stayed safe and went with bbq chicken wings for app and a cheeseburger for dinner. Both were good. Pints of craft beer were $3.50 on the night I came, but not sure if that was an opening week special or the normal price.

I have a couple of things to call out:
1) For a place called Brewstone, and with craft beers all the rage, the draft beer selection is weak. I counted 20 different draft beers, most of which are available anywhere you go (Bud Lite, Sam Adams, etc.) I expected a wider selection of craft brews on tap.
2) I would expect a place that has made such an enormous investment in audio / video equipment would likewise invest in sports programming. I'm sure they'll have the NFL Ticket package, but come on guys, throw us a bone and get the MLB package for the summer. On this night, the Pirates had played during the day and so virtually every tv was showing ESPN programming. I can stay home a see that.

Don't come for the culinary experience. This place is about sports on tv, and music when no sports are on.","0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ",3,"2012-07-27",0,"review",0

Before an annual holiday trip to Vegas, I stumbled across this activity as something I could redeem my Chase credit card points for, so I went ahead and did it and I'm glad I did! My girlfriend and I like going to Vegas every year but this was just what we needed to keep it interesting.

The hour-long bus rides to and from Pahrump were comfortable and informative, with Mikko being our guide and doing an excellent job. The blind tastings on the bus were fun even if I didn't do so well! The wineries were nice and the people that worked there and gave out tours were amazing! I learned A LOT about how wine is made in general and in a place like the Nevada desert at the first winery, Pahrump Valley Winery. The folks doing the tastings were also very pleasant, especially Jack, the owner of the second winery, Sanders Family Winery -- he was hilarious, very knowledgeable and just great to listen to. He makes you feel like you're family and just having a glass of wine with a friend.

As for the wines...well, wine is a matter of taste and I'm pretty much like Thomas Haden Church's character in Sideways where I think it all tastes the same, but there was one wine (Burgundy) at Sanders Family Winery that I really enjoyed to the point I bought a bottle, not something I usually do while wine tasting (typically the tastings themselves satisfy my wine craving for months). I've always been more into wine tasting for the experience and beauty of the vineyards, and the two wineries met that requirement as well. Finally, the lunch at Symphony's was VERY good. I had the grilled chicken panini with steak fries and it hit the spot, especially after all the tasting. 

It is worth mentioning that there is A LOT of wine included in this. Two lengthy tastings at two wineries (plus tasting any other wine you want after lunch at Pahrump Valley Winery) and the blind tastings on the bus was quite a bit...I won't say too much because I did, after all, sign up for wine tasting, but it came to the point by the end of the day I was sure I didn't want to drink wine again for a loooonnnnggg time. It didn't help that the second winery, Sanders Family Winery, didn't have any crackers or anything of the sort to go with the wine (I recommend you bring some), but it was only a minor scratch on an otherwise great experience I highly recommend!","1FkUTet5GQ5mVwNLw_Ds4g",5,"2015-01-11",2,"review",1

We got to taste over 20 wines throughout the entire day, most of which were delicious! Lunch at Symphony's was also delicious -- I got the French dip sandwich and steak fries, both of which were of great quality.

Both winemakers were knowledgeable and hospitable. The second winemaker, Jack Sanders, is just a blast with his witty humor.

By the end of the day, you will most likely be a little ""wined out"" - 20+ samples is no joke... But if you have a free Saturday or Sunday and need an excellent date idea, or just a fun way to spend the day with a wine-loving family member, I strongly recommend Imbibe Tours!","1FkUTet5GQ5mVwNLw_Ds4g",5,"2015-02-21",1,"review",0

It started with wine tasting on the drive out to Pahrump (location of the wineries), about an hour drive.  We then had a tour of the Pahrump Valley Winery followed by a wine tasting and a delicious lunch (and a glass of our favorite wine). Proceeded to the second winery, Sanders Family Winery, where we had another set of tastings.  On the way back to Vegas we had our last three tastings.  All-in-all we had about 22 tastings and a full glass at lunch, plenty!  I highly recommend the tour, it's fun, easy, and goes by way to quickly.","1FkUTet5GQ5mVwNLw_Ds4g",5,"2014-08-24",0,"review",0

We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit ""homey"". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value. Those who love amazing wine, great food and education on how a winery runs will not be disappointed!","1FkUTet5GQ5mVwNLw_Ds4g",4,"2015-01-06",0,"review",0

They play pretty decent music as well. You start your drinking before you even get to the winery. As soon as you hit the road, they pass out a sample of mimosa. Then you get to try three different wines and guess which one is which. They give you a pen and paper to write down your answer. The food is marvelous!! You get to try about 20 different wines at the first winery, then you get to eat there as well. If that wasn't good enough, you also go to another winery and try about 10 more wines!!

Although they do buy jewelry, it's clear they would prefer to consign it.  My mother was urged by a salesperson several times to go this route even though she was clear the first time that she was not interested in consignment.  

Also, instead of making her an offer, the jeweler asked what she wanted for it.  I don't know if it was their intention, but it came across to me as an opportunity to take advantage of a customer that may not know the market value of a piece well enough to ask for a fair price.  My mom did ask for slightly more than the offer she had just received, but the jeweler's response was only ""I can't do that.""  No counter offer.  If they weren't interested in buying the piece (although the salesperson did remark they had sold a similar watch recently), I would have preferred the jeweler be up front about it rather than wait to see if he could get it for nothing.

In addition to jewelry, I did also notice they have quite a bit of blown glass art in the store as well.","4_is86ZOnM9JcpBvsB04pw",2,"2010-11-07",3,"review",3

I've had friends order custom jewelry from Elliott in the past so this experience today came at a complete shock. 

I called early in the day and explained that I had inherited some jewelry from my father that I wanted examined and quickly appraised for tax basis purposes. I came into the store a few hours later and it was very clear that the woman, named Kimberly, working had no desire to help us- she had to end a conversation with her friend to greet us. 

As I explained who I was and that we had earlier spoken on the phone, she became very hesitant and distant. I began to remove some of the jewelry pieces from my bag and I explained that, because they had a gigantic sign ""WE BUY GOLD"" on their door, I may be interested in selling a few non-sentimental pieces. 

Anyway, before she even took one look at the jewelry, she began quizzing me about the circumstances of my father's death. Invasively, she sternly asked when I came to acquire the pieces, whether or not anyone else was inheriting things from my father's estate, and whether I had a lawyer overseeing the process. When I said that it had been less than a month since my father passed, the woman began lecturing me about how when her mom died it took her about a year to sort through her affairs and that I was moving too quickly. She told me to go ask my lawyer to explain it to me. 

Being a lawyer myself, I was appalled how unprofessional and discourteous she was. It was in no way her role to inject herself in my affairs and she absolutely lost business because of it. I couldn't even get a simple appraisal for tax basis purposes. It was clear that she came into work with a bad attitude, but I would never go back here and I wouldn't trust giving my money to a business that employs people like that.

That's right.  On behalf of all the homebodies out there let me be the first to review the Corningware Corelle Revere Store in the hinterlands of Dufferin and Sheppard. 

I have a nice Corningware casserole dish, you know, the nice white one with the fluted edged that you'd being to potlucks.  It was woefully underused in everyday applications because it only had a clumsy, albeit pretty, glass lid that neither sealed nor allowed for stacking.   I also have a square pyrex dish that was missing a plastic lid thanks to a mischievous puppy.   

Enter the Corningware Store. Not only do they have the lids for my orphaned Corningware and Pyrex dishes, but they also have all sorts of kitchen gadgetry and essentials with an emphasis, of course, on food containers. 

It would actually be an amazing place for a housewarming gift, or a very practical wedding gift, or a just-because-gift for your friend of a certain demographic.","6zLxqXt4IEXbCH4d7T_6GQ",4,"2011-04-20",4,"review",2

Yes, it's a save the last dance/step up kind of dream but dreams are quirky.  You want what you want.

I told this all to the husband, he quickly agreed-not because he really wants me to achieve my dream-he didn't mind spending a day in Madison every week.  

The dance space is nice, a bit over the top pink but there was a respectable mirror ball.  My instructor, Jeanne, was friendly and, more importantly, helpful.  The first 15 minutes was a little warm up, learning some pretty easy choreography and then the majority of the class was learning a longer hip hop piece.  We learned a chunk every week and put it together at the end.  I felt pretty accomplished by the end of the lessons and wanted to continue the dream...

The studio offers lots of different lessons, even a thriller workshop or a britney spears set of classes, and---my next dream: west  african dance.  I had been to Mali and there is really nothing to compare dancing with live drums; you are alive and you are joyful.

How did I not know about this place?! Stumbled upon it on boxing day of all times (one of the few places open this day and most of them happened to be in Leslieville). 

So this is the Avro: I walk in and someone I know from Elementary School yells out my name. I then find out that I know the bartender, Neil, who used to work at the Mercury Espresso Bar. Then I had a girl come over to me and asked me if she knew me (she was on a bar crawl). That's this place. 

What I like about this place is that it seems that most of the activity is centered at the bar. I've never seen a place where's there's a bigger bar then there is room for seating. Neil's in a band (two, actually) so the soundtrack here is great. The bathroom walls are a makeshift chalkboard so there are messages all over the walls in chalk. Love it!

I opted for the drink of choice when I was around 21:  the amaretto sour. We then moved to whisky sours as they were out of amaretto (when does this happen?!) but I didn't like it so it was comped and I got a double gin and tonic. Great alternative! Super nice of Neil to negotiate.

I came in here w a girlfriend for a low-key Saturday night to grab a drink, and were sitting at the bar. The very first thing that I noticed was that it was pretty much pitch black in here without the grace of a few dim lights behind the bar.   It was about 11:30pm and this cozy place was rammed!  When I say 'cozy', I mean you're actually squeezing your way in between seats and people that you can barely even see in a low ceiling little nook (I keep saying ""nook"" so much that I might just start referring to Avro by it haha).

The music they were playing was not bad, but seemed really loud in such a small place.  They have a few beers on tap, and a bunch of liquors as well.  There is no kitchen, so what you see is what there is... I think (I didn't quite explore, but it didnt seem like there was much to explore anyway).  They do have FIVE munchies selections, and my friend and I ordered 3 of the five.

Pickled Egg: $1 (2/5 stars)
Kept in a big cookie jar behind the bar, I watched bartender fish one out for me.  It tasted like a hard boiled egg with vinegar, and I added tobasco to it.  

Meat on a Stick: $1? (4/5 stars)
Can't really go wrong with spicy cured sausages.  They were pretty much the thicker hot rods.  I think they were kept in the fridge since it was served cold.

Toasted Fluff: $1 (4/5 stars)
This was our fave!  We watched the bar tender scoop up some marshmallow fluff with 2 teaspoons and then used a torch  to torch it.  That was it! We licked the toasted sugar off that spoon till it was clean!  One of the regulars at the bar told us we should have gotten the Campfire Shot and chased it with the fluff.  Sounds great! Maybe next time...

They also had mini packs of chips for $2 and birthday cake for $3 a slice!

Overall, this place is quite cute if you just want to come for a few drinks.  I will probably come back again on a weekday sometime and check out the atmosphere then.","0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw",3,"2012-06-03",0,"review",1

LOVE that they have drink specials from 7-9pm (1/2 pints for $2.50! YES!) Happy Hours on a Saturday night are a rarity, so I thought this was pretty cool.

As mentioned by other reviewers, the Avro is quite tiny and dimly lit. Kitschy decor which appeared to have some kind of retro ""aviation"" theme.

Upon arrival, we discovered that the bartender/owner happened to be old friends with one of our group. She appeared to be managing the entire bar by herself. She explained there was NO FOOD available at the Avro (we were hungry) but she brought over a stack of take-away menus and told us we could have food delivered to eat in the bar. Pretty cool.

Walking in on Saturday night, The Avro smelled like vanilla sugar and Stiegl beer and joy.  So, basically: some of my favourite things.

The music was pumping, people were chatting (AND SMILING!  LET'S PUT IN A COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO DO MORE OF THIS, K TORONTO?!), and we sidled up to the bar.  An orange-kissed beer was on tap.  Vodka sodas flowed easily.  We considered the food board: $3 slices of birthday cake, ""meat sticks"" and pickled eggs on offer.  Another plus of The Avro: outside food is welcome, so show up with your tub of hummus, slice of 'za, and bag of neon Cheetos...bienvenidos, all!  

This joint is small, and chock-a-block full of delightful quirk.  Cheeky signs, Backstreet Boys album covers behind the bar, and a big jar of the 'forementioned pickled eggs.  Come here: drink one, drink all!

The ones from the movies where people sit on a stool and swill beer for an extended amount of time.  The one where there is no real drink menu.

I shall be honest - we only ventured here after being turned away at the Comrade which was full.  I'm so happy we got turned away.  The Avro is awesome.  First off, it is TINY but the vibe is real.  I felt like I'd walked into a time machine.  Their drink list is concise and they make a delicious bourbon sour.  The music was classic rock and the bartender wasn't chatty, she just served up the drinks. 

The bathrooms deserve a paragraph to themselves.  Mannequin with no arm and a toque with a happy birthday balloon, a cheetah or leopard (choose your own adventure), kegs and air tanks with a paint can holding the paper towels.  OH, and of course - the walls are chalk tagged.

We decided to try it out Friday night - getting there for around 8pm it was already pretty busy. The bar is quite small with a couch at the front, a few tiny tables that sit 2-3 people and plenty of seats going along the bar. We were able to get a seat no problem but if we'd shown up at around 9, we would have been out of luck or needed to squeeze in on the barstools. 

As I said the place is much smaller then what I thought from the photos I'd seen. Don't let that deter you though! The Avro just might not be the venue to go if you have a large group. For 2 to 3, it's quite cozy and intimate with a great atmosphere. Eclectic decor throughout, and warm low level lighting.

The bartender was really cool, very attentive and aware - so saw my short self struggling to be seen behind all the people sat at the bar, and was able to get my order through quickly. The beer is cheap and good, just how I like it, and if you're feeling peckish they have birthday cake.

Apparently cheap pint nights on Thursdays if you show up in plaid and lots of events and live music regularly going on. If I lived East this would easily be my local and I plan on going back again in future when in the area.","0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw",4,"2011-03-07",3,"review",3

While the draught selection is limited to two beers (Organic and one other), the bar makes up for it with quirky character and charm.  Throughout the evening, there were a number of draws for free drinks, of which everyone was a part of.

A greater variety of drinks would also be appreciated. Neither of Ruelo's locations present themselves as a truly sit in venue. I got the espresso and earl grey flavored macarons, they have lots of east Asian inspired ones. Both were airy, light and bursting with flavour.

Considering the macarons were $3.00 and $2.25, I had my expectations set quite high! Alas, I was to be greatly dismayed! 

The $3.00 Ruelo tasted like a Ferro Rocher macaron...you would expect a Patisserie Chef from LCB with a Diplome de Patisserie to be a little more inventive. The hostess very sweetly mentioned that it tastes like the mass produced chocolate too. I mean if you are you going to create something that tastes like a mass produced chocolate...a. Why price it at $3.00 and b. Why make that of all your macarons your SIGNATURE macaron!!
 

Not sure if Chef Jacqueline Lo was trying to be adventurous with the recipe of the Salted Caramel Macaron! In addition to being hard and dry, it was also sticky... kind of almost like a Sticky Salted Caramel Toffee. If that was the taste she was going for...SPOT ON! If not, either I got a really bad batch or may I suggest the chef make some changes in the recipe.

My sister who had the Blueberry Cheesecake didn't seem impressed and told me the crust of the cake borders on overwhelming the taste of the cheesecake. 

The reason I awarded Ruelo 2 stars is because my friend on facebook mentioned  that their Croissants were great and since I have tried it, I ll just have to take her word for it. On a plus side, great customer service!

Surprisingly, the macaroons offered were not the best, a little too sweet and a little on the artificial side.  Even at $15.99/person it could have been better!

The Kusmi tea was nice, not spectacular but aroma and taste were good.  

Aside from the afternoon tea set, we also shared a chocolate pastry dessert,  It was a chocolate mousse dessert with vanilla creme brulee filing and crispy praline layered on top of chocolate cake .

So we went in and dazzled by the lovely colours and sights, my friend I ordered just two macarons - and lattes. I didn't bother trying the pastries as they didn't seem to look appealing - not bad, just not amazing for the price they were asking. I don't even think pastries in Paris were priced this high...
We ordered the Rose Lychee and Pure Chocolate. After biting into them, I noticed mine had a slight freezer-burnt taste. My friend also noticed the same - after exchanging bites, it was confirmed - they were definitely directly from freezer. Maybe it was the day?  Not sure but it was a let down - simply because visually, they looked so good. We didn't finish them and won't go back :(","61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw",2,"2013-09-21",1,"review",0

I instantly regretted the three freaking blocks north I had to walk from where I was visiting to go to this place on a hot humid day. But since I was already here, displaced three whole city blocks away, I thought that I may as well check this place out. My laziness knows no bounds. The interior was arguably nicer, gives off the impression of a small quiet place, tucked away from the rest of the city. 

What was I here for? Macarons of course. Ruelo Patisserie is truly inventive with their macaron flavours, they have your typical chocolate and vanilla macaron that every run-of-the-mill French bakery have, and they also have flavours like Green Tea Sesame, Yuzu and Wasabi Grapefruit (I'm seeing an Asian influence here, don't you?).

Ruelo offers coffee/tea, baguette sandwiches for breakfast/lunch, sit in desserts, macarons, and bread. You can also order small cakes here and weddings cakes too. Prices here are steep; macarons range in price according to its flavor and can go up to $5 for one! Macaron flavors include: wasabi grapefruit, cream cheese orange, early grey etc. Small 6"" cake here costs around $28.

They also have a very small list of espresso beverages and a nice variety of loose leaf Kusmi tea. I got an Americano ($2.95) and I didn't enjoy it too much- too watery and somewhat bitter. Tea here will cost you $3.75. Extra 75cents for iced or a slice of lemon. I wanted to pair my Americano with a macaron or sit in dessert but they had no desserts on the counter and only a small selection of macarons left over, no flavor which I was interested in. Also, I wanted to see their bread, but they did not have any. Prices for macarons, sandwiches, and cakes are not listed in the store which I didn't find too helpful.","61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw",2,"2012-11-18",3,"review",2

I didn't expect this because the store in unassuming and was manned by a Chinese  teenage girl who didn't know much English, but the macarons are near perfect. I love the flavours, my favourite being the creme brulee and the rose-raspberry-lychee, and the macarons are just how I like it. A delicate shell with a moist, dense but still airy centre. The fillings were sweets but not to the point it is off putting.

They also have individual serving cakes that look like small works of art.  You almost feel guilty cutting into them.

I really don't understand why they chose a Groupon promotion if they were just going to end up compromising the store's reputation with it.  The macarons were frozen, none of their good flavours were included (no choice, and some were completely unpalatable), limited variety, and by the time they had thawed, they almost all tasted off.  Some were definitely frost bitten.  No lie - I've had better macarons from Loblaws.  The attitude I got picking them up was aloof - borderline snobby.  I appreciate I'm not a full paying customer with a groupon, but isn't the point of this promo to try and make me one?

I did have a better experience when I paid full price for the macarons, to be fair.  Service was pretty shoddy, regardless, but I did get to try a few different flavours.  Some are good, some are experimental and off-putting.  Macarons are chewy, rather than soft, and not all of them were fresh.  For the price, no way they're worth it.  If you're going to be charging several dollars per macaron, I'm expecting the quality to be on level with Nadege, and this just isn't.

My favourite was definitely the raspberry lychee. Samples of the other goods on offer were okay, but I don't know if I would have paid the prices they ask for.  An iced latte was $3+ and the 14 oz mug was filled with about 3/4 ice! I had to knock some of the ice in the garbage so I wouldn't spill it on myself.

Overall I was very surprised by the limited number of things for sale. The cakes looked very similar and beautiful, but to be honest I didn't try any because they looked like mousse or cheesecake and I'm not a big fan. I thought they would have more cakes with fondant and other types of pastries.

If you are a macaron aficionado, this is certainly the place for you (if you're willing to pay their prices). I hope they can stay in business but with this limited offering it might be a challenge.

If you are into port and / or sherry, don't expect to see here very much to select from. You have your standard harveys and grahams and then it's all Canadian cheap imitations suitable for cooking and cocktails but not drinking as is.

We asked the sales representative for a size and she asked who it was for. My friend said it was for her and the sales rep looked her up and down and said ""Oh"" very rudely. My other friend not picking up on this said "" Yes, we also saw a matching shirt we would also like to try on"" and the sales lady turned to my friend and she ""these clothes are for women only!"". My friend turned bright red and said she would like to leave now. The sales rep then proceeded to say that there might be some jeans that might fit her. We walked right out of the store.

All of us are biologically women and were shocked to receive such horrible service from such a well known store for its quality and taste. My friend was incredibly embarrassed for being mistaken for the wrong gender and we were horrified that someone would tell someone they could not purchase the clothing they want to because they are not the ""correct"" gender for those items. 

ESCADA, please remind your sales representatives that they should never guess the gender of a client based on appearances (not that my friend looks anything like a male) and that if looking someone up and down and giving them a look of disgust is completely unacceptable.

I'm not lying when I tell you I LOVE SWISS CHALET. It is my go-to comfort food and it is always consistent every time. It's been quite some time since I last ate it but I had no doubt that it would not disappoint. Sadly - my expectations were a whee bit high.. both on the food and the service.

The corn (side dish) was also dry, and over cooked - pretty sure it was microwaved.

Firstly, pipe down this is my review...feel free to rebut at a later time :)

And secondly, don't be too shocked but it's true - I still listen to radio. And yes, before you ask, I have an iPod that I also listen to voraciously because apparently every moment of my life must have a soundtrack.

And while I don't remember how I stumbled upon the station a couple of years ago (though it's been on the air in Toronto for just over 30 years) what I do know is right from the get go, I was hooked.  

Now rock (the focus is on classic rock but that covers more recent years then you'd think) isn't everyone's cup of musical tea but it's where my heart lies so rarely do I hear a song on the station I don't like or don't know.  To give a bit of background let me be clear that radio is my music comfort zone....I leave discovering new music for my web surfing hours 'cause that's just how I roll ;)

Aside from the fantastic music, the thing that keeps me hooked are the DJs and the various radio personalities. They all love what they do and love the music they play, that comes across loud and clear, not to mention the specialized knowledge they all seem to have spanning decades of music - which makes a nice change from the cookie cutter personalities on other Toronto stations that move from one station to another without blinking an eye.  The morning show with John Derringer, Maureen Holloway, Ryan Parker and Bill Hayes is incredibly entertaining each day and when you know how much I hate dragging my butt out of bed, you then know how good they have to be to make me laugh at 8 am.  Joanne Wilder (9 am - 2 pm) is great to listen to at work and Kim Mitchell (yes THAT Kim Mitchell) does a great afternoon show (from 2 pm - 7 pm including the rush hour drive home) and there's Andy Frost and Al Joynes too.  My personal favourite though is the DJ on from 7 to midnight during the week, Alex Hindmarch...the guy's got a casual style that is super appealing and entertaining.

Another draw for me...and I think fellow Yelpers might find the appeal in this too...is their theme and ""top lists"" weekends.  Each weekend of the year tends to have either a theme (this past weekend was ""80s music that doesn't suck!"") or a countdown (usually reserved for long weekends and feature lists like ""Top 107 lead guitarists"" or something similar) that is voted for by listeners.  I enjoy both but LOVE the latter...I've been known to go out of my way to make sure I'm available to hear the top 10.

So while I may be a relative newcomer to the station itself, they've got themselves a loyal listener for years to come :)","4Ok7Xh7DSujMhe2uWhQdwg",5,"2009-04-28",2,"review",2

 When I needed a quick and very flexible approach to a kitchen expansion Richard reacted both with speed and also understanding that we could not close the kitchen during trading hours. Richard scheduled the work in a logical sequence, suggesting aspects that could be carried out away from site and were then installed after the kitchen closed each day - with minimum impact to trading times.


 The work was carried out on time and on budget and after each session the kitchen space was left in a clean and workable condition ready for the next morning.


 I'll definitely be using Property Repair again this autumn for the next phase of the expansion project.

The recently renovated a little near the back for DJs. Now they have these wooden benches and have covered up the ""exposed kitchen"" look in the back, which looked more like a storage unit. The place is pretty tiny so you might have to dip and dive when things get really busy. There are very few places to sit so be prepared to stand.

The owners of Unit are very nice and the staff is always pleasant. There's no attitude when it comes to this establishment.

Unfortunately, the first thing I noticed and the lasting impression is that it is filthy. Tables, chairs, highchairs, floors, toys - sticky, grimey, straight up nasty. There's a layer of dark filth over most of the toys. The play area was nothing what it looks like in the photos. There was no train table which is what J was looking forward to but there were trains and some tracks on the floors. Many toys are in opaque bins on the shelves rather than being visible. J still enjoyed it, it's just unfortunate how filthy the place is. We were there for almost 2hrs. We sat next to an empty table with dirty dishes. The dishes were cleared away and they're really good about that but crumbs and sticky mess left behind seems typical. It wasn't busy or anything.

Just vile vile stuff here in terms of espresso drinks.
Desserts are way over priced (3.50 for mini cup cake that has frosting which belongs in the garbage). I am all for supporting a good cause but this is plain ridiculous. I am sure some management type came up with the idea to turn this place into cafe for revenue generation but instead of charging regular cafe like prices I would say just have a donation box at the counter and have people pay what they feel like here.

Upon entrance of this place I found it to be pretty comfortable. The decor is pretty nice and unique. As I walked further into the cafe, after I ordered, I spotted a little play area for kids. This is quite an interesting thing I have never seen before.

I ordered the Latte and was not overwhelmed. In fact, it underachieved in my opinion. It was ridiculously hot first of all (I am pretty sure it's not supposed to be nearly boiled!) and secondly there was not much punch to the coffee itself. This could be as a result of the Roaster they buy from (Alternative Grounds), but it could also be the barista.

The food selection is quite disappointing as well. Everyone who walked in asked for a food menu (although I don't think a menu is necessary) and were told there was muffins and bagels...that's it. Also the baked goods were frozen and not fresh, which is not great.

The reason this place gets a 2.5 star instead of just 2 is for the creativity of thinking about children by creating a place for them to play at.

My impression is they are having a hard time with business, but I will give them credit for trying something different.

I don't think I will be back here, but it has serious potential.

First of all, I asked for a brewed coffee (on the menu) and the person working, who I assume was the owner told me that she just ran out and wasn't brewing another pot because she wouldn't sell it all.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  It's brewed coffee.  And also, that's not my problem.  So I ordered a soy latte instead, and it was awful.  I'm not even a coffee snob!  Trust me, this was BAD.   

The ""play area"" is tiny and the floor was filthy.  My kid's scooting leg was black.  They need a gate.  It's not about drinking coffee and not watching your kid, it's about  general safety.  It may be better for an older toddler (like 3 or 4) but my 1 year old just kept trying to crawl into the kitchen area.

The play area is small and not fenced in and I don't mind at all. In fact, I think it's a smart idea as it's not the staff's responsibility to watch your kids while you chat and eat but the play area is there to make your life easier and your child's visit more pleasant.
There is a train table with full tracks and trains, a kitchen with all the dishes and fake food your kids need to ""cook"" and make believe, a bookshelf packed with books and other various toys. The floor plan is open and quite roomy and the bathrooms are incredibly kid friendly with flip down child toilet seats and lots of stools.
There is a kiddy menu that is very reasonably priced and tasty. The food overall is pretty good but simple since there is no full kitchen so the owners do the best they can. There is a liquor license. Oh, and the best vegan cupcakes from Sweets from the Earth that I have ever had I am not vegan.
In the Summer there is a small patio and the front doors open up but are blocked by a large leather sofa so kids can't escape. 
The owners are the friendliest and most open ladies I have had the pleasure of meeting and this is one of my go to places now when I want to enjoy a tea, lunch or brunch with a friend or group of friends.

My daughter likes the grilled cheese or pizza. She didn't even want to leave to go get ice cream! lol! That's the hard part, getting your kids to leave.
I really suggest going here if you are looking for a nice relaxing cafe experience that your kids will enjoy too. This is not a kids cafe or an indoor playground. This is a good cafe that caters to adults and makes their lives a little easier by providing entertainment for the kids. This is a community cafe.

They also were aware of us being first time cat owners, and asked us many questions of how we would take care of the cat - again showing how much they care.
Practically, if you're looking for a cat, I would recommend going there a few times because their cats often come in and out (especially indoor cats and kittens) and make a wise decision when you find the right cat for you and your situation.

Situated just outside of town in Bonnyrigg  Lothian Cat Rescue runs a substantial service for rescuing kittens and older cats from unsafe or abusive environments, and does its very best to rehouse them.

Lothian Cat Rescue is a charity and is run by volunteers. They have a small charity shop on Easter Road near Leith Walk in Edinburgh which hopefully raises a small amount for the ever costly upkeep. They do charge a small amount for rehousing but this is a more of a gesture to show you care enough and can afford to take care of the animal.

Before visiting you should call them up, tell them what you're looking for (e.g. older cat, a cat that gets on with children etc.) They will ask you to come in and view the cats which are all housed in pens and receive regular daily attention. The staff will ask you questions about where you live and what your environment is like, this can seem a bit interrogation like, but I really respect the care and consideration they take into the future of their temporary guests.

My girlfriend actually volunteers here, and can say from experience what a great service they provide behind the scenes. The regular feeding, attention, vet visits etc., which all come out of the rescue centre's pocket. They receive cats constantly, and there is a high turn around (they do their utmost to never put a cat down) yet they still offer very considerate attention to each individual.

I really respect any people or organisation that goes out of its way to help animals, especially volunteers. So often, these charities face funding problems and are less well received than more ""vital charities"". Being a big cat fan aside, I have to disagree and think this job is just as necessary!

 They ask for a donation when you adopt a cat which I think is very fair as the cats come with a health check and after all the cattery is a charity.","7gYCEhh_g_3nDzo4ofUmiQ",5,"2009-01-22",0,"review",0

There is one Asian lady i like a lot i forgot her name though my fault. I also got a pedicure from them as well they did good.

PROS:
* inexpensive 
* good color selection
* nice people
*television available

CONS:
*Some of my tips are longer than others
*When i got a pedicure the water was so hot it burned me feet and they came out of the water looking like cherry tomatoes
*whenever i seem to give them the tip off my visa they seem almost disappointed since its not cash (i dont carry cash and im not starting anytime soon)
*the language barrier but its no one's fault
*the massaging pedi chairs are made for people taller than me *sigh*

Since the cons outweigh the pros it gets 3 stars but you are still getting really good service considering how much you pay for it and i will continue to give them my business because the lady who gave me the pedicure was really nice and she did a really good job getting rid of my callouses and didnt torture me too bad (im extremely ticklish).","-jEWdfyvYOHV4Os85OuorA",3,"2010-06-30",2,"review",0

I am SO sorry to say this, but I've been hiding a lil gem all to myself. China Buffet is my all-time favorite chinese food buffet. We're always greeted with a smile and a nice autmosphere, I like the sing-songy contempo chinese pop in the background, it's not too loud so it's good. 

The dining area is vast and is always kept clean. The uniformed staff are always on the ball - clearing plates as soon as you take your last bite and always offer to refil drinks.

The food is very very good. I love the bbq pork. The sesame chicken & beef n broccoli are favorites of mine as well. Their wonton soup is super yummy! I always start every meal a nice bowl of a couple of 'tons. lol. 

But the real attraction for me is the Sushi Bar!! Their sushi is real hit or miss... but is more hit than miss... and since it comes with the meal - it's worth atleast taking a gander at. Their salmon nigiri is always good when in stock, as is their shrimp nigir - but I have had a couple of pieces of bad tuna nigiri, which disappoints me but I still go back and give it a go. When tipped well - the sushi chef will make things to order. The sushi isn't the best in the city - by far, but it is good. 

I've taken a lot of people to China Buffet and everyone liked it except for one friend who thought their abolone was gross... but abolone IS gross... regardless of where it comes from. 

And so i say unto you, my fellow yelpers please forgive me for keeping this place a secret. I hope you try China Buffet and enjoy your visit. It's one of my favorite places to dine anywhere and I constantly use this place a measuring rod for the new chinese places I visit and they rarely compare.","7XRbA_t8UNxMHkdslLd5Tw",5,"2008-10-21",3,"review",1

I must admit, I am a little excited to write this review. I had to wait and let myself cool down.

My sister just came back from Cali and while there tried boba tea. I was shocked she has never tried...nevertheless we were on the search for boba tea.

Being from Portland, OR and loving FatStraw on Hawthorn for its boba tea I had somewhat predisposed standards of the the root based little novelty . Little did I know Our House was not operating on the same level...

I had the Strawberry..
Both of my little sisters had Taro..
We all had boba in them


Sister 1 did not like the little boba and wanted to exchanged it for a different drink. My lil sister...barely 11 walked up to the counter and politely asked only to get rejected, she walked back sad, knowing she either dump the drink or power through the drink. I then walked up to the employee and discussed a few business ethics and standards that AZ and USA operate at a normal basis.  With his broken english he refused any refund or exchange transaction....I thought to myself...all this for what... for his poorly made product? Pick and choose your battles.

Sister 2 did not lik the AZ based boba tea store...she wished she was still in Cali. Don't we all.

Me: It cost me just under $4.25 for one drink w/ boba, tack on an additional $.50cents for the fact that I used a debt card!..So i payed 4.75ish for a drink made with powder and NO customer service..","7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A",1,"2011-10-05",5,"review",1

Dublin Street, opposite the Stand Comedy Club. It's useful to know about if you are about to see a show at the comedy club, or have just had a busy day shopping at the nearby Harvey Nicols shop. Otherwise, there are better pubs to visit. They have 2 tvs showing sky, but the setting of the pub has a barrier in the middle so only those sitting or standing directly by the tvs can watch them. So this makes the small pub even smaller. When there was a bookies next door a lot of punters would come in and watch the horse racing at the weekends. The bookies has now closed so the pub is usually very quiet. It does have room for 4 tables outside, so if you are lucky to be there on a sunny day, grab one of those. Their food menu is better than you might think. I've had chicken and bacon wrap with fries a couple of times and it's tasty and generous portions. Not much atmosphere there though, so there are better options usually.","0g0LbDsPabCHbQN8Za7YpQ",3,"2009-02-03",0,"review",0

"2121",0,"DRVEe9OZqBox9iWgFyB8SA","3tjUy_JXTYHyY1JchY8uxA","At this airplane-themed vegan resto you have a choice of either bowls, sandwiches or salads (seasonal, but who really craves a cold salad in -30 weather anyhoo...). My dining companion and I went for bowls - she chose the brown rice with Mexican Mole sauce, marinated tempeh and asparagus/beets. Mine was a quinoa with pumpkin-fennel-cashew purée and grilled zucchini and steamed cauliflower. Both had nice little mache, sprouts and a drizzle of balsamic - a beautiful and well-rounded dish. My only critique would be that the purée wasn't hot (or even warm) and neither were the veggies and the quinoa was only slightly warm. Consistent temperature (either hot or cold) would have been preferable as it was an odd mix. I'll just be sure to request that next time as regardless everything was delicious and clean-the-plate worthy. 

The service was very warm and the selection of drinks both alcoholic and non was nice - kombucha, tisanes, coffees, smoothies etc. No room for desert but they had coconut-banana and coconut-mango ice and other sundries that were tempting. 

Halfway through our meal we had a lovely surprise where one of the staff started playing the piano...instrumental music - mostly covers ranging from Daft Punk to Bjork to the Mamas and the Papas. A nice touch. Will most definitely return.","7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw",4,"2014-01-30",1,"review",1
"2122",0,"jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q","aqERrLMMAbhsvZNt6gf2xw","Every once in awhile I have a meal at a restaurant that exceeds all my expectations, and it happened recently in of all places, Montreal, Canada.  In a city known for smoked meat and french fries loaded with gravy and cheese I had one of the best meals ever at Propulsion Cantine Vegetalienne. A Vegan restaurant  with an Airplane theme on the famed Saint Catherine's Street.  From the menu to the decor, from the waitress to the owner, this place is funky, fresh and entirely unexpected. Simone and I brought some friends with us who were Vegan and we actually arrived about twenty minutes before closing. I was a little nervous that the service and the food would be sub par because of the time of night but we were happily greeted on arrival by the quirky and funky waitress whose name I cant remember but whose personality I can never forget. She was more then willing to talk our ears off about the entire menu and about their new restaurant that has only been open since mid summer 2013.  The decor is aviation themed including a mannequin of a 1950's pilot and many parts of an actual propeller plane that had crashed and the owner had bought and turned into the bar and some seating tables.  It is all very cool to look at while waiting for the food.  Speaking of food, we decided after speaking with the waitress that we would just let her decide what to eat and so she started us off with a sample of a cool and refreshing cucumber smoothie. From there the four of us split a create your own bowl.  This was a imaginative concept where you choose a combination of grains, vegetables, and sauces. We went with a Pesto Bowl and had Quinoa, Bean Based Pesto, and fresh grilled Zucchini and roasted Cauliflower in it. Although completely dairy free, and thickened with garbanzo beans, this was the best Pesto I have had. It was creamy, nutty and garlicky great. The quinoa and vegetables were cooked perfectly as well and this was a great start to the meal.  Next we wanted to explore the sandwich menu (all sandwiches come with tempeh in them and of course your choice of fresh, moist, light vegan breads) .They all sounded so good our waitress suggested we split a variety of them and she would be sure the kitchen would cut them into portions for us. I didn't think it would get much better after the Pesto but these sandwiches were just over the top great.  The choices we went with were the Lentil Cari sandwich ( my personal favorite), The Mungo Mango ( voted by my friends to be the best), and The Purple Taro Portabello (still good but third on the voting scale). The Lentil Sandwich on Turmeric Bread was tempeh with a lentil patty that had a hint of curry and spice and just the right amount of smokiness, The patty held together on the outside and when you bit in the lentils were cooked perfectly tender but not mushy.  I have never had lentils that tasted so good in my culinary life and the only thing that upset me about this sandwich was that I had to share it with the rest of the table. It was my absolute favorite. Next up was the Mungo Mango. This was also pretty good and consisted of Chinese Mung Beans and Fresh Mango's  with tempeh on Fig Bread...It was earthy and sweet and everyone at the table loved it also. Lastly was the Purple Taro Portabello.  It was also good (and very purple) with mashed taro and sauteed mushrooms with tempeh but I found it to be a little soggy and less flavorful then the other sandwiches.  By the time we ate all the food it was past closing but when we asked the waitress if she wanted to cash us out to help with closing she told us not to worry about it and then she went and ate her own dinner.  We ended up staying for awhile longer and chatting amongst ourselves and with her and it was only when the kitchen (and pilot outfitted owner) had started to leave that we got our check. On the way out we took some vegan cookies with us for the road and they of course were great.  That night I dreamed of Lentil Sandwiches and so the next night Simone and I went back for another helping of sandwiches, pesto and good conversation with our friendly waitress. There was also a great piano player that second night who was amazing and we ended up staying again until closing. Everything about Propulsion is five stars, in the future they will be adding Vegan alcoholic drinks and fresh local salads. I hope that people check this place out because it truly is a hidden gem and I hope that I will have the pleasure of many return visits when I travel to Montreal.","7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw",5,"2013-10-20",2,"review",0

La décoration dans le style aviateurs des années 60 est vraiment cool et donne tout son charme à cette place. Le bar est une aile d'avion (c est vraiment cool) et ils ont un vieux congélateur et un vieux frigo des années 60.

Pour l ouverture nous avons eu droit à un musicien qui jouais du piano et ce sera la cas tout les vendredi et samedi soir et avec un thème différent a chaque fois d'après ce que le musicien disait. On a aussi eu droit à un spectacle de danse de salon, toute ces petites choses font qu on se sent bien dans ce restaurant.

La serveuse était très dynamique et à l'écoute des clients et malgré que le restaurant était plein son service était très rapide.

Le propriétaire de la place qui est aussi le chef a vraiment réussi à accomplir une chose formidable (le restaurant). Il passait à l avant et on pouvait lui parler un peu même si il était dans le rush. Puis j ai adoré sa tenue style mécano : salopette, chemise, vieille casquette et goggles.

Pour les desserts, le gâteau avec glaçage à l'érable est un régal !

Et qu'on ne s'imagine pas un comptoir à la Subway; tout est préparé à partir d'aliments frais et bio dans la cuisine pour ensuite vous être livré dans un bol genre ""petit cul-de-poule"" ou ""gamelle à chien"", dépendamment de vos références de vie.

Mais Propulsion, c'est plus que de la nourriture, le gars avait une idée encore plus poussée derrière tout ça. Voulant donner un aspect théâtral au souper de ses clients, on peut donc jouir de la présence d'un pianiste qui se donne en spectacle les vendredis et samedi durant toute l'heure du souper. Ça, en plus du décors style rétro sous le thème de l'aviation (Le bar est en fait une réplique d'aile d'avion!), ça vient créer une ambiance vraiment agréable et qui sors de l'ordinaire. Par contre, je cherche encore le rapport avec la nourriture végétalienne et les avions... Et soulignons la serveuse qui fut d'une rapidité exemplaire, je veux dire, pour un souper d'ouverture et un restaurant à presque pleine capacité, j'ai vraiment été impressionnée par son travail. 

En tant que nouveau restaurant végétalien (ça pousse cette année à Montréal non?), ils ont réussi à se démarquer grace à leur concept original. Est-ce que ça va être assez pour les faire survivre à la forte compétition qui commence à s'établir dans le milieu? Je leur souhaite!

2-3 minutes later, and a quick discussion with our server, my meal was on the way. They were extremely happy to customize just about any aspect of my meal to make me happy, and the food that came out was delicious.

Then there's the price--so affordable, I'd really expect to pay a lot more for the size of portions and quality of food you get here, it's definitely a great place as far as money spent/value goes.

The only negative for us were the tables. Ours was a re-purposed airplane wing which, while cool sounding, really sucked as tables go. I'd make sure you specifically refuse those tables if you're offered one.

The falafel was delish, the butternut squash cakes too. Pizza was mediocre. 

Note that the food is slightly more expensive than posted on the online menu - they need to get that updated but it seems to be about 10% higher now.

I'll cut to the chase, because its unforgivable. We ordered a couple apps and a couple cocktails. As I was eating a sweet potato won-ton, I bit into a large chunk of dirty plastic that had obviously come from piece of machinery used to prepare these over-fried pieces of tasteless, greasy cardboard (on a side note, it was served with some sort of ""spicy Thai"" sauce, which is really a scoop from some giant vat of mass produced combination of soy sauce, fake ginger, and MSG). 

When I told the server with a shocked face, he seemed so indifferent and complacent that it was almost some sort of a normal occurrence to him. ""Oh, okay,"" as he took the plate away without any question. I asked for the bill immediately, and when he returned with it later, he told me he had removed the offending item so that we wouldn't be charged.

Listen... I just chomped down on a piece of machinery and it hurt. Don't think you're being some generous prince by knocking the thing off the bill. I gave him less money than the total -- basically enough to cover the drinks -- and told him that's all he was getting. Again, no reaction.

Here's where I tell you that the menu sucks; the crab cakes taste like they came from MM Meatshop; the stale olives in the martini tasted like aluminium. The only saving grace was the readily available boxes of Trivial Pursuit cards, which quickly lost their novelty.

This is what concerns me most: we came here because people on Yelp said it was decent. Trust us, and just walk a few doors down to Volo instead. They're pricks, but at least they have great beer.","DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg",1,"2010-09-19",2,"review",0

I arrive late to meet with lovely ladies Chris P and Elaine K as they are conveniently seated at the very first table which is seperated from the entrance by a large glass pane. The  atmosphere is intimate and laid back as they had a little fireplace going completely decked out in tinsel and Christmas regalia.  

The menu is a concise offering of delectable comfort foods.  I order the Butternut squash cakes to share which is 3 pieces, Panko Breaded with Corn and Red Peppers, served with sour Cream spiked with scotch bonnet peppers. The cakes are delightfully crisp and savoury and nicely complimented by the tangy vinagrette marinated cucumber strings.

The ladies order their respective meals and I order the Green salad with poppy seed dressing topped with grilled chicken and I have to declare it is the best salad I have had in a long time as the warm chicken along with the fresh greens and flavourful poppy seed dressing is a medley of deliciousness happening in my mouth.

The meal was actually pretty reasonably priced as the total for 1app a big salad and two entrees came to about $56!

Kudos and thanks to the lovely Chris P for choosing such a great cozy spot for a lazy rainy Monday dinner get-together. I highly recommend Local 4 for that perfect little place to escape for a pint, some good food and good conversation.","DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg",4,"2011-11-15",0,"review",0

For having to be somewhere after dinner, the chunk of time the overall experience of dining here took really took away from the fact that the food was really good. 

However slow speed is not the only reason local 4 receives 3 stars, the overall atmosphere in here is not really my thing, with plain tables and chairs and nothing spectacular done. It's a simple bar, friendly staff and I know if I lived around the area, local 4 would be my go to place for drinks and good food. But since I don't, while the beer selection is OK and the food is great, I doubt I will come here often. It is definitely worth repeat visits though. The menu is a little on the pricey side as well, but at least the food is good.

The falafel was possibly the best I've had and the chicken quesadilla is also great. You add free board games in to the mix and this is a place that everyone definitely needs to visit for a not too fancy exprience.

They serve top-notch pub fare alongside some quality beers (but needs to be more seasonal, lagers and pale ales just don't satisfy in the dead of winter and they were out of the oatmeal stout. nb: Guinness in a can doesn't count as stout, or a beer for that matter) and just happened to fit my craving for comfort food on a really cold night perfectly.

I had a wonderful meal starting with their delicious butternut squash crab cakes, which were served with a scotch bonnet aioli that had no scotch bonnet in it.  While it was a puzzling omission, it was a lovely starter. For my supremely comfortable entree, I had the beef bourguignon, which was a hearty stew of button mushrooms, thick-cut carrots, cippolini onions and tender chunks of beef with what the chef likes to call ""pear mashed potatoes"".  This blew me away when it was served, and I thought it was unique, clever and bloody delicious. They take a heaping mound of mashed and shape it like a giant pear, and then quickly deep fry it, and top it with a whole clove as the stem. I had to smile and marvel at its elegant construction before I hungrily devoured my plate. I splurged on some sticky toffee pudding for dessert as the meal was so perfectly hitting all of my gastrogenous zones, and it did not disappoint. It was a large piece and while they were a bit light on the caramel sauce, my waistline didn't need any more abuse on this particular occasion. Everything was perfect, and it was just what I needed on a windy and oh-so-cold night. 

The atmosphere and decor are wonderful, it feels really comfortable and homey in there. Also, the music deserves some kudos, they were playing some bad-ass underground hip hop when we got there which transitioned to the entire Led Zeppelin's Early Days album.

Service was fantastic, however, we were one of 2 tables when we arrived, so I would expect fairly undivided attention.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable and ensured that I will certainly consider Local 4 again in the future.  The prices are reasonable given the high quality of the food, and if my only complaint is a lack of beer menu, that's a forgivable sin and a common gripe of mine.

First of all, it was August and it had rained, so we opted to sit inside. The a/c wasn't turned on, so it was hot and muggy despite the ceiling fans. They proceeded to turn on the a/c which couldn't possibly have been working because we were still sweating. 

We ordered the sweet potato fries ($8) and the artichoke dip ($9) as appetizers. First of all, for the price of the appetizers, we were expecting A LOT more than a small plate of fries and a ramekin of dip. The ""crostini"" that came with the dip was inedible...literally. They were burnt and rock hard that they were impossible to bite into. I asked for some pita bread instead which was softer, but had been ""grilled"" which gave it a burnt taste - likely the result of a grill that is not cleaned very often. The sweet potato fries were slightly undercooked and were served with a watery chipotle mayo (great flavour, but thin consistency.)

For entrees I ordered the falafel which is touted on the menu as being the ""best in the city"" and for $13, I had pretty high expectations. Let me just say that for $5.99 I could've had TWO falafels, double the size, just down the street. and i'm sure they would've been much better tasting. 

My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. I liked the fries, but he said the sandwich was only okay.

Overall, the food barely deserves even one star. It's over-priced and borderline inedible. The atmosphere is lacking...not much to it, but not in a new-age minimalist way. I would describe it as drab. I WILL say that the service was friendly and I also have to mention that I did like the plates they use (straight out of the '70's).","DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg",1,"2010-09-03",2,"review",1

It was a jerk chicken sandwich with avocado salsa with an arugula salad with strawberries, almonds, and poppy seed dressing.  

The chicken was tasty... not sure if it was really jerk chicken...but I'm from Scarborough, so I'm a bit picky when it comes to jerk chicken.  (Brup brup). The salsa had large fresh chunks of avocado.

 I found this on Yelp and was glad to find a BBQ place so close to my daughter's apartment I'm visiting.  I was the designated child care for my new step-granddaughter this afternoon so I said, ""Hey, let's go out to lunch!""  We headed for Andrew's 2nd location on Southern near Dobson.  First impression--specious, clean, bright, cheerful. 

 The Kids Meal seemed a little high at $5 till I saw what she got--about ten little mini corn dogs (she only ate two, though she liked them, just eats like a bird), huge pile of excellent fries, and drink of choice (chocolate milk). The mini corn dogs were fixed really well, deep fried like little fritters, crunchy and crisp.  I got a BBQ pulled pork sandwich on a hamburger bun with one side (cole slaw) also for $5.  The pork was tender and non-greasy, had wonderful mild flavor, and the BBQ sauce, which you pump as much as you want out of a big jug, had great flavor.  There was a spicier version available if you preferred. Cole slaw was very good--I forgot to ask if it was homemade by them but it tasted like it could be.

The girl behind the counter was very cheerful and didn't rush me in choosing.  She said she usually works at the Guadalupe location but I'm glad she was here today.  

As we sat and ate a leisurely  lunch I looked around and started noticing all the rock and roll posters and even album covers that seemed to be from the 70's and 80's, maybe a couple of 60's.   That added kind of a unique touch to the place.

I recently visited Andrews on my tour of local BBQ eateries. The food is ok but not outstanding, but I'm not impressed with the value.

A full rack of ribs is $20, which is only a dollar less than at Famous Dave's and comes with only one side and a stale white bread dinner roll. The flavor of the meat was good though it was too charred for my liking, as if they hadn't been selling enough to keep them from overcooking (no surprise). But if I'm going to pay Famous Dave's prices, I want a plate and no styrofoam.

The sides weren't memorable, but the building certainly was. It looks like an Arby's that two pre-teens repainted with a couple of cans of barn red, black, and teal paint.

You receive 2 packets of tarter sauce, and can purchase more for $.5 each, and if you love tarter sauce like me, you'll need it. 

The chips are delicious, and it's all a generous portion. It only took about 10 minutes for them to get our order to us, which was to go. You can sit in, and the space is warm and comfortable, and they make it very evident that this is supposed to be a Scottish establishment.

Here's what you should know if you come down here:
1) Best place to catch some sun is on the little deck next to the pool where you can do laps - it's a bit quieter because it's further from the kids.
2) The showers are pretty gross.  Because I live close I just wear my bathing suit there and home.
3) It's free!
4) They obviously have a limited capacity.  It's actually not too crazy at full capacity - the hard part is getting in.  It opens at 10 so I'd suggest getting there closer to 10.  By the time I left at 2ish there was a huge line waiting to get in.  
5) Bring or wear rubber flip flops, the floors are gross in the change room and you do not want to be walking around barefoot!
6) They don't have concessions so pack what you might want to eat.  I'm not sure you'd be allowed back in if you stepped out.

You can frolic and you can swim without interrupting others. Unfortunately, you do get the precocious little kids who eschew the kiddy pool and want to be more grown up than they are.

I've done a lot of pole classes before (one of my closest friends was the first instructor when Stripper 101 opened) so I thought this would be fun. It's in the Thunder From Down Under showroom. We got there 30 minutes before class as instructed so we could fill out the waivers, get our ""dancer names"", and take pictures with the pole (digital camera, all loaded onto the website). 

If you've ever been in the Thunder showroom, you know it's packed with narrow tables. Those have all been cleared out and replaced with round platforms that have poles in them. Our instructor gave us a brief background of herself (she's a show performer that's done a lot of major shows in Vegas) and then we got started. She walked us through some fun little chair routines, stripteases, and finally a few basic pole spins. When the class ended she walked around to talk to all the students and offered to take pictures.

It's a lot of fun if you come with a big group. They have a number of local discounts and group package options. They also let you take photos throughout the class which may or may not be a good thing (especially bad if you're planning to use the photos for blackmail). 

If you're comfortable with them, wear heels. It's more fun that way. Because you need to stick to the pole better, don't wear any lotion if you can help it and try to wear short shorts so you can get more skin on the pole (sounds weird but it helps keep you up on the pole). 

I will definitely be back since they do a lot of class specials and the price is pretty great for girls who've never done this kind of class and want to try out something fun!","1OX9AggXkC9tlijv0zgcog",4,"2012-02-25",4,"review",1

I'd say the best thing about this package is the convenience of having activities planned and scheduled for a large group as everyone can purchase their package online and pay on their own. It's much easier than having to book each individual activity on your own. 

We started off our day with the Pole Dancing Class, followed by Thunder Down Under, then went clubbing at Light afterwards. 

Pole Dancing Class - We had a lot of fun with this class. The location is at a Pole Fitness Studio so the room was nice. However, we were unaware that the class was very very booked and each girl had to share a pole with 1 other person. In the end, the instructor was a good sport and taught the class in a way that allowed each person to practice moves 2 times. It may not have been communicated that the class was shared, but in the end we had fun and I liked my gift bag. The T-shirt and panties were very very comfy and I event wore them the next day. 

Thunder Down Under - At $30 a ticket, this was a pretty good deal. For the TDU tickets, we picked them up after the Pole Dance class at Excalibur. I thought we got a really good deal for the tickets since we were front and center, so our bachelorette got a lot of attention. Seats at the show are very very cramped, but this doesn't factor into my rating since it's something Night School 4 Girls can't control. Just a tip to be aware of :) 

Nightclub Passes - While picking up the tickets for TDU we tried to get the nightclub passes at the same time but we told to come back right before the TDU show to get them. So before the show we went and got our passes which were in enveloped. We got a 
- wristband for Marquee & Tao 
- A VIP pass for The Bank 
- A VIP pass for 1OAK
- A VIP pass for Chateau at Paris 
- A VIP pass for Light at Mandalay Bay
- A VIP pass for LAX at Luxor 
- a few other things like show passes and and vouchers for drinks at other places

We opted to go to Light since it's close to Excalibur. When we got to Light around 10:30. We showed our passes to one of the people who was managing the line and that person told us to wait in the regular GA line since they didn't recognize the pass. 

I took the pass to show it to a promoter who was helping people in. He didn't recognize it either, and neither did anyone at the front entrance of the club. One of the staff told me they didn't recognize the pass and that it wasn't valid at all. At this point everyone in our group was feeling dismayed since it was a bachelorette party and we were surprised to find out that the ""VIP"" on the card didn't really mean anything. 

We stood in line for awhile and I decided to text the promoter listed on the sheet of paper that was included in our envelope and listed as the contact for Light. There was no response, so I figured that the passes were basically useless and we would just have to get in on our own. We eventually found a promoter who pushed us to the front of the line and got us in. We then tried using the passes for the 2 free drinks they were listed for but no one in the club recognized them. 

Seeing as we were invoiced for $33 each for all of the passes on our bill we really questioned the validity of the passes. In the end, I would just opt out of this line item and save yourself the stress and find a good promoter.","1OX9AggXkC9tlijv0zgcog",2,"2015-02-11",1,"review",0

NS4G office works M-F, so there was no one to call to fix the problem.

Make sure you go to the right place. So we had to rush over there from the hotel. My sister walked up first to let them know that we were running late while, we found parking. DO NOT park at the MGM parking lot like we did, it is REALLY far and we had to walk about 15 minutes, speed walking in 100 degree heat to race over to the venue. Luckily? they said it happens all the time, that girls go to the hotel so they let it slide that we were late. The class itself was okay, the instructor was nice and funny. I like when would do a move and say ""look at my booty"" and smack it. Overall, nothing wrong with the class itself but nothing to write home about either.

I figured we would just pick it up the day of, but when I tried to do so, the manager? told me she made  ""an executive decision"" not to offer these tickets at the class anymore.

We also had to go in 3 groups for using the pole, so we only learned 3 or 4 pole moves.  The gift bags were fun, but the shirts were one size fits all and we had girls in our group from small to XL, so not everyone ended up with a shirt that fit.  Also, the boas seemed like they bought a regular length boa and cut it in half, I've never seen such a short boa before.  There were some funny moments throughout the class and the instructor was nice and also entertaining, but I didn't learn much and my friends and I were left somewhat dissatisfied.

I bought some night club passes and specified the date as a Sunday because we could only go Sunday or Monday.  When we got the night club passes, they did not match what they say we would get on the website. There were only 2 options for Sunday.   I called one of the clubs that NS4Gs website said we would get a free drink from and the club said no, we would not get a free drink and if we wanted to use the passes (to get in), we should show up no later than 10:30.  Also, there were no monday options.   I emailed them about it and they responded once, when I replied back, they never replied back to me.  So, basically the night club passes were a complete waste of money for us because we didn't get to use them at all and their website is kind of misleading because they don't list any day/time restrictions (I didn't see any at least).  I guess I should have called ahead and confirmed that what the website says is correct and that there were options for the days that we wanted to use them.

Only real positive was that we got front row seating for the Thunder show - which was hilarious and a lot of fun.  

I personally would not do this again.","1OX9AggXkC9tlijv0zgcog",1,"2014-08-10",0,"review",0

My step son who was Gay, was murdered on 11/14/2011 in Las Vegas
(google Phil Wells) as stated by my wife Sandy K..  When I arrived in Las Vegas Thomas Lahey of I'm positive called my wife to try and help with anything that we needed as far as the arrangements and any outstanding debt beyond what I could afford.  Since I did not know Thomas, nor did I know how he got my number, I told my wife in my Bronx Sicilian accent, no dice.  I later went to the ""Escape Lounge""
in Las Vegas where my step son was a bartender and met with Thomas.

Not only did ""im postive"" help with the finantial burdon (I maxed out two credit cards) of transporting Phil's body from Las Vegas to LA, plus the funeral and stone, but he went  beyond what he said he would do and helped with many other areas.

The cost just for transporting the body from the Coroner's to La was $4600.
I told Thomas that any help that he could provide was appreciated, however,
not one dime should go to me or my wife beyond the cost itemized cost that I will provide and that he can audit.  All funds that ""I'm Positive"" is able to receive beyond my cost must go to a HIV and/or animal organization.  I have close personal political friends in NY and they know what took place with my family and they will get this message, hopefully via Yelp. 

Thomas turned me into a true beliver of this company and I wanted to get the word out to others that have family that are in  trouble.

Dan will switch the workout for different days. Ours was all arms and shoulders and some squats. The air bike was a nice cardio addition- the more you push the better the breeze. I also like how the stations would stagger- strength, cardio, strength, cardio. All around great workout. I like the interval concept (multiple intervals of going all out, with rest periods in between) because it forced me to push myself but not get overwhelmed mind or body like I usually would over a long period of workout time.

When I first walked in, I noticed the awesome music playing and unique lighting around the mirrors. This created a fun environment right away. As we got into the workout, I loved the structure of the stations and intervals throughout the rotations. For me, the intervals broke up the workout nicely and kept me motivated and focused for the duration. The idea of alternating between cardio and strength stations is fantastic. It keeps the workout fresh and exciting. And speaking of cardio...the treadmills here are fantastic. These are not your generic off-the-lot running machines. I found my knees and feet thanking me for the ergonomic comforts of the treadmill belt. I loved that my knees and feet did not hurt after using them, which can sometimes be the case with all the pounding from a regular treadmill.  Although it is a group class, the workout is differentiated for your fitness level. You are in control and can really work to find your own individual push pace. Personally, I like the guidance of a trainer to encourage, support, or correct me as I go through the workout. This helps me to keep going throughout the workout, and also prevents injury. Push 40 consistently offers that, which is hard to find at gyms.

All of the stations allow you to push yourself to your best, without ever feeling like you're not capable of completing the exercise. My coach was Sarah and she was great!

I walked into the store at 2 o'clock on a Monday, figuring things would not be too busy. First up is lighting for outside the garage. I walked past the ""Help Desk"" with a guy in his apron. Stood in the aisle by all the lights.  15 minutes later I walked by the guy with his apron and moved on to the window coverings. Oh, did I mention that he never got out from behind the ""Help-less Desk""  to see if I had any questions?  NOT!

Well, it's on to the Window Coverings area, where I had a couple of things on my list.  I know what I want to buy, but, again, blew 15 minutes rooting through the displays without finding what I need.  Oh this time there were 2 sales types with aprons standing there chatting.  Do I detect a pattern here?

Next up, is a handful of things in the garden department.  Along the way I passed 4 or 5 Apron types without anyone offering a smile or asking if I need help.  The Garden Department is rather large as is my list.  I wandered through the aisles past 3 Apron types looking for things, but by this time my patience is running thin. I decided to leave.

On my way to the exit, I passed a couple of Apron types and not a one acknowledged me.  Hey, I get it.  I am invisible!  Next stop is Victoria's Secret to offer a hand in the changing rooms.  Being invisible does have advantages!","3EjcQBo6wGAGBBcCfM5_WQ",1,"2015-03-03",0,"review",0

My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.

In the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:

1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.

2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  

EVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  

Another rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.

Before looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  

3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  

So the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish.","3EjcQBo6wGAGBBcCfM5_WQ",2,"2014-05-06",0,"review",0

The place had no vibe and didn't feel very welcoming at all. We didn't end up getting anything to eat and had a quick drink and bolted.

Regal Beagle is located in that strange area of hotels and apartments on Bloor Street. It's location isn't very exciting as it has that strip-mall kind of steez to it.

She was having a conversation with a group at a table, and while she kept turning around to look at me, she never excused herself to seve me.

Finally, when she turned around to grab another menu for the table, I politely asked if she could pour me a beer. And this is where she got really rude. She told me to wait, because it's ""rude to interrupt a conversation"", and when I didn't say anything she muttered that I need to wait for her to get on the other side of the bar. When she was finally at the taps, she lectured me, asking if I've ever worked in the food business (yep, chef and server for four years) and how she's entitled to have a conversation. Then she called me rude, condescending, and inpatient. I was too shocked to say anything else. After she poured my beer, she thumped it on the bar and walked back to the group without a word.

While we were sitting on the patio, she bothered us a few times about ""buying another beer already"". I will never, ever, be going to the Regal Beagle again.

A small, locally owned boutique that I'd be more than happy to support for all the reasons mentioned above, however, I have a huge problem with one minor detail. 

Their return policy.

Shopper beware. If you are anything like me, you don't return items often. In fact, I hate returning things. I feel like it's a waste of my time to the point where I've kept items that I really don't like because I just don't want to go back to the place I've purchased them (or to the post office, but really, who wants to go there). I found out today, after purchasing 2 dresses 5 days ago and deciding that I really didn't need both (each very cute, but I live in t-shirts and jeans--one dress is plenty) that I couldn't return my least favorite dress of the two. Their return policy states that you can exchange the item or get store credit w/n 14 days of purchase. 

I know you are a smaller business. I know you lose money on returns (heck, every store does), however, if I get home and decide that on second thought, I really don't need/like the item enough to keep it, then I should be able to return it (in the same condition that I purchased it) within a specified period of time. Make it so you have to return your items within 7-10 days, but your customers should at least have that option. 

Maybe taking 2 stars off their rating is a lot (3.5 stars is probably more fair). But after today, I don't have a strong desire to shop here again. I have shopped at small boutiques that have decent return policies and I will continue to shop at those stores, I'm just really no longer interested in this little shop.","HOxFZFlHMHkLuRz21h_5bw",3,"2013-09-26",0,"review",0

We got our table around 7:30pm, but it took another 30 minutes for the waiter to take our order.
The quality of the food was ok: the do-ré-mi appetizer was very good, but the salmon tartar was very salty. The ribs were good (could have more vegetables on the side), but there was way too much salt and clove in the meat pie. You don't need that much salt when the flavours are good to begin with.

But the worst part was that at 10pm (remember, they took our order at 8pm), slightly after we paid, the waiter asked if we thought of leaving soon because another group was waiting for our table ! Of course, he waited after we paid his 15% tip to ask us to leave. We were finished and would probably had left 5 minutes later, but it's the first time anyone at the table has every been asked to clear the table at a restaurant.

A near-400$ bill for a table of four, took an hour before our order was taken, salty food, and being asked to leave the table 15 minutes after dessert is served... There are too many good restaurants in the area (graziella, local, l'appart, helena, ...) to go back to this grange !

To the owner: booking three services on the same table for a night without enough staff to allow for a quick service, no hostess and no manager on a saturday night might be you're idea of a profitable restaurant, but count me out.

However, my reason for a minus one star goes to the prices. I find it pretty pricy to my liking considering the serving sizes ie. tapa-like. I would definitely go back for drinks for a 5 a 7 or hanging out with friends on a Saturday night, but I wouldn't be going back for the food just because I could find cheaper somewhere else in downtown for the same quality food but at a much larger portion.

La première fois, c'était à l'occasion d'un souper par un soir enneigé du début janvier. C'était sur semaine et le restaurant n'était pas très plein. L'ambiance était chaleureuse, tranquille et agréable. Nous étions 4 personnes et nous étions assis près de la fenêtre. Le serveur nous a fait d'excellentes suggestions en matière de vin. Les tapas étaient divins. Nous avons essayé un peu de tout et partagé quelques tapas entre nous. La facture s'est avérée assez salée, mais nous avons mangé et bu pour le prix! J'ai adoré cette première expérience.

La seconde fois, j'y suis allée avec mon copain pour le brunch et j'ai moins apprécié mon expérience. C'était en juin, je crois, la fin de semaine. Le resto était bondé, en partie à cause d'un groupe de très nombreux touristes, ce qui a ralenti sensiblement le service. On a mis près d'une heure pour nous servir. Heureusement, la serveuse a semblé avoir pitié de nous et nous a offert un peu de pain en attendant. J'ai trouvé que pour le prix, le déjeuner était des plus ordinaires. Toute cette attente pour un brunch qui n'avait rien d'exceptionnel, bof.

The Carson Lynx Station is the ""last"" stop on the line before the lynx crosses over I-277 and into Uptown.  It is also good to note that the trail still continues on under Moorehead, but then diverts you over to Moorehead/College St if you are trying to walk in.  No pedestrian traffic allowed on the light rail bridge over 277.

A lot of folks get on the train at the other end of the line in Pineville, so by the time the train reaches Carson, it's pretty packed (depending on the time of day... I'm talking rush hour when it is pretty packed).  No men employed to squeeze people in the trains yet (like Japan), but if you value your personal space, I would either try to get an earlier train, or just avoid the rush hour altogether.

Other than that... pretty standard light rail station.  No park and ride here.... but lots of residential places nearby and you've got TWC News 14 building behind the station off of South Blvd and the Midnight Diner about a block away.","6assZ_-OP7jfbvbkk_U5iA",5,"2016-07-21",2,"review",2

A down-to-earth, friendly server invited us into the restaurant while we were loitering at the door, looking at the menu.  ""C'mon in and give us a try,"" she said, ""We make all our food fresh to order and have something for everyone.""  It was a hard invitation to resist, although we did note that the restaurant was mostly empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  So maybe not for everyone?

She quickly brought fresh bread, sun-dried italian olives and olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the table.  Nice opening.  We're starting to wonder why more people aren't populating this lovely place.  The menu is pretty standard with pizzas, pastas and mains.  The soup of the day is a cold gazpacho.  I brazenly ignore the fact that it's a spanish dish and order it, along with a pizza.  My husband orders a squash agnolatti with a tomato basil sauce.  I thought that was an odd combo (I'm more of a brown butter and sage person with squash-filled pasta myself), but it sounded good.

The gazpacho arrives quickly and it is delicious - bright and creamy tasting (maybe some olive oil inside?).  

But the mains were strangely put together.  My pizza had a perfectly chewy thin crust, but the toppings looked and tasted bland (except for the very good olives).  It oddly had very little flavour and the cheese was cheap tasting and heavy.  It was like Pizza Pizza meets Pizza Libretto.  Weird.

The pasta dish had the same problem.  The sauce was delicious.  Very rich and flavourful - like you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.  But the pasta itself was overcooked and the filling had the density of the spackle we are using to patch the walls of our new house.  No flavour at all and leaden.  What's going on here?

My guess?  The chef has a split personality and only one of them can cook.

The same reason I've encountered  there in the past- the poor service.  Specifically the 69 year-old head waiter whose snarky arrogant attitude and indifference has no place in an overcrowded restaurant market, like Toronto's.

Although my wife & son both enjoyed their most recent meals, I made the mistake of ordering one of the specials of the night: Lobster & scallop pasta.

3.) The food server picked the salsa and sour cream bottles out of a container with melted ice and the water from the bottle dripped all in the burritos and rice bowl as the items were poured;
4.) The food server continually touched the tortilla to her filthy shirt as she made the burrito;
5.) The food tasted stale and the salsa was not good;
6.) The bowl was almost the same price as Chipotle yet it was half the size;
7.) There weren't any other customers and the servers stared at me while I ate; and
8.) They didn't have any type of sign for visibility.

The girl was very smug and replied, the difference is we make all our own food.  Hmmm, ok, well let's give you a try.  We wanted a chicken burrito and a chicken salad.   The girl was slowly making quesadillas one at a time, and said our order would be a while. When our order arrived, the salad was tiny and all thrown together. The burrito was supposed to have guacamole, and had a tiny bit in one end. Beans were undercooked and tasteless.  Rice was bland and resembled minute rice from a box. Chicken had no identifiable flavor at all. We were not impressed with the food, atmosphere, ie wwf smack down really loud, or the food.  There were only a handful of people there, and the quality of the food is probably why.  We won't be going back.

First of all, the first time we went they were out of guacamole, lettuce and cilantro.
The staff was super friendly so I decided to give them another shot today. 

Today they were out of straws and medium sauce. *sigh*The salsa was good but the beans were really hard and my tortilla was burnt. I had to pay $2 extra for guacamole and there wasn't hardly any in there. 

The portion for the burrito was HUGE but the beans were hard so it wasn't super enjoyable.

Braids were large  (counted 48 braids)
Braids uneven
The braids on the crown are awkwardly placed
Most braids taper awkwardly

Yes, with its location, I am sure it attracts a lot of nearby offices which honestly is fine by me. At least their patronage keeps The Charlotte Room in business.

I never had a bad experience here. The staff is friendly, there are 7-8+ beers on tap plus other choices via bottle. It is a small quaint place, their back room is cool, with exposed brick and comes with an upright piano in case your heart is moved and you to play.

Very laid back vibe, with a lot of warm accents, it's quiet and with a touch of class. 

I do not eat here, simply because their menu strikes me more like snacking menu than an actual meal, plus there are no tables to eat at except for their high and poker tables (yes you can do that here too!). After all, this is a lounge not a restaurant.

Their pool table rental fees are quite higher than let's say Rivoli's so if you do play pool keep an eye on the ticker since it could add up.

My friends and I went here to celebrate my departure and we were told great things about this place. 

When  we first walked it, it was quiet and full of people in there 30s. We didn't mind since we all are in our 20s. We found a few places to sit near a pool table since we wanted to play. We waited for a server to come but she looked too busy chatting with the older people beside us to even pay attention so we went to the bar ourselves and ordered. The gentleman bartender was a total ass. He gave us snoody looks and didn't treat us like his other customers. He gave us so much spazz and attitude because we ordered a whole bunch of drinks that he had to make. 

Anyways, we went back to our sitting area and thought it would be good to play a game of pool. I went up to him and asked for the supplies needed. He gave it to me and said to return it on the hour. Whatever, we did that and we payed. We decided to play for another hour. When I went to ask for the white ball, he told me he couldn't give it to me because there were people waiting to use the table. 

I noticed that there were 3 other empty tables but I figured the customers had prefered this table. I didn't mind. My friends and I waited for two hours sipping drinks and talking. NOO ONE SHOWED UP and the 3 other tables were still empty! 
I went back to ask him if we could play and he told me no. That we had already used it for the night.  So I asked if we could relocate and use another table. He seemed to get angry by my asking so I dropped it and we left. 

DURING THAT WHOLE TIME, THE FEMALE WAITER WAS STILL TALKING IT UP WITH THE OLDER PEOPLE BESIDE US. SHE DIDN'T PAY MIND TO ANYONE THAT WALKED INTO THE PLACE.

The Charlotte Room is tucked away in a side street, Charlotte Street oddly enough, that allows it to have a nice secluded patio away from the majority of traffic.  You enter either from the patio side, or in the winter, through what appears to be an apartment or office building-style lobby area.  The first time you enter it sort of takes you aback.

Once you're in the Charlotte, you're faced with the main reason many go there.  Pool tables.  Several tables wait to be played all in good repair.  The bar at the back is full service and the menu is small and focussed, relying on pub-food faves.  TVs are available to watch sports on in the comfort of comfortable furniture.  It sort of feels like a gentleman's club (not that kind of gentleman's club, thank you, remove your mind from the gutter) for the non-executive type.

There is a side room that is also available for performers of many kinds.  Typically it's open to the likes of poetry readings and the like, but once a month, the Charlotte opens its doors to free stand-up comedy one Saturday out of the month.  I've been lucky enough to be on a few of the shows, and the crowds are always great.

Halfway down on Front Street at Spadina, suddenly she has a change of heart, RSVPs to a party, and after a painful impromptu massage, I found myself at BCBG Max Azria shopping for her outfit for her function.  I love it when things work out. 

Apparently, Claire is a regular customer, which meant the Italian/Korean sales girl dedicated an exhaustive amount of time tending to the both of us.  I say the both of us because I was very much involved in the dress selection process...since I'm like amazing and have impossible taste. 

This location is very well stocked; at the front of the floor are where all of the ugly casual outfits are which appear to be melting off of the rack.  When you dwell deeper into the store the whole atmosphere changes, and although these are not the prettiest dresses in the world, I felt comfortable with what I was surrounded by.  
Long gowns, cocktail dresses, body napkins and mad fashion experiments.  I didn't think I saw a single outfit here costing over $500.  Although, In my opinion that's a steep price to pay for the mediocre stitching, and non-precious materials.  However, there was something any girl would be able to squeeze into, so I definitely saw how this store can be a life saver for a girl on the go.  

Nicole--the sales girl--remained very patient while maintaining her pearly whites while Claire rifled through every potential dress in the store.  I sat on the lounge in the changing area, and felt like somehow I wasn't supposed to be here.  Each change room was curtained off, but this was still technically a female change area.  But hey, nobody said anything, so I enjoyed myself while approving and disapproving each dress Claire tried on.  I really appreciated how spacious the changing area was, and how sectioned off it felt from the sales floor.  

After what must have been forty minutes, I finally grabbed a sequence dress off of the racks, shoved it into Claire's arms and watched as she fell in love with herself in it.  $440+ later (with an 8% discount) I was shaking Nicole's hands and we got the hell out of there and marched off to Yorkville for some much-needed sushi. 

Claire was very impressed by my affinity with women's fashion, and I was very happy with how much she trusted in my advice.

Ein brauchbares Eis halte ich aber eigentlich auch für eine Grundvoraussetzung.

I'm afraid the writing was on the wall from the day it opened. 

1)  There is some stiff damn competition in this neighbourhood.  If you're looking for a place where two people can get a delicious, unpretentious meal for under $50, you've got Churrasco of St. Clair, Stockyards, Mezzetta, and Vannis - and that's all within 50 meters of the corner of St. Clair & Christie.  If you're willing to go another block or two, you've got great Mexican and good Indian, too.  

2)  You're selling burgers across the street from Stockyards.  Yes, Chuck had better seating and a liquor license, but the food wasn't as good and there wasn't much of a price difference.  

3)  The ambiance was all wrong for this neighbourhood.  Did I call it ""nouveau abbatoir"" in my earlier review?  I should have.  If I'm looking for a haven after a long day at work, I don't want  bare bulbs and an interior that looks like it was designed for easy hosing off.

It's a shame - the staff were always really nice, and the burgers weren't bad.  I hate to see a place go under in my area, but the mix was just wrong.

I dropped by for takeout poutine on election night; the place was dead silent, and I was a bit uncomfortable as I waited for my junk food.  The stench of death was on the place already.  I got home, and the portion was huge and piping hot - but the gravy was bland, and I pitched a good chunk of it out.

Looked like a nice place, but oddly, completely empty.  That's always a worry, but we went anyway.  Apparently, they won a prize for best burger in Toronto Life, so must be okay.  Noticed that they fry burgers on a griddle instead of char broiling though.  Odd for a real burger place.  Isn't frying a burger a bit like boiling toast?

So we ordered.  I had the award winning Montreal Burger which featured smoked meat.  We also had a Juicy Lucy which has mozzarella inside it and a portobello mushroom burger.  We ordered some fries which arrived first, like a  starter, which was odd.  They were good, but fries are meant to go with a burger.  That's basic burger stuff to me.  The burgers arrived after we finished the fries completely.

The portobello burger had two small and limp mushrooms rather than a nice big one, so that was disappointing.  They were pretty greasy too.  My Montreal burger was okay, but as it was fried, not a great flavour to me.  The buns were kind of heavy, so I didn't like them too much either.  The Juicy Lucy was missing the cheese completely, so back it went.  It arrived a bit later and it had the cheese but also a kind of funny smell and taste.  It seemed to us like the meat might be too old.  I didn't like it at all and the others didn't have this taste or smell, so that was worrying.

So, I guess I know why it was completely empty when we arrived and when we left.  Service was charming and friendly, but that's kind of small potatoes.  These were not good burgers.","3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ",1,"2011-09-29",0,"review",0

E-Tea is somewhat small but has a large counter where they serve different types of bubble teas, iced-coffees, Italian soda's etc. My intention was to buy some bubble tea supplies for home but the guy working there did not have any. Instead, he directed me to Asian markets around the area where I could find some; I thought that was really nice and helpful.

After looking over the gigantic beverage menu, I decided upon a mango bubble tea. The bubble teas here are made out of powder and come in one standard sized cup. I paid around $3.77 for a cup which was about 14oz. The drink was refreshing and the tapioca was cooked perfectly. However, the mango flavor did not taste too much like mango which was disappointing.

Eric, the owner, can usually be found at the end of the bar with his newspaper and a friendly welcome for all his members and soon-to-be members. (To join is a very reasonable yearly rate.)

This place is private and doesn't have to follow the new no-smoking policy; however, they've been smoke-free long before the local ban went into effect, so the previous poster's info about DB being smokey is outdated.

While DB doesn't serve food, they allow you to bring in your own and will cover a pool table if you're having an event there and you bring in catering.

Wow.  I am trying to give you my money, my patronage, and you're telling me to not even bother?  Some customer service.

I understand that the phones were taking a while to switch over/ activate but their banter about what they wanted for lunch/dinner (they were deciding on glass nickel) and hearing how one of the guys working was about to stand up in his sisters wedding was too much for me. Waaaayyyy to much. I also heard all about the old sprint sales associate who just quit and how another pen called out to work today,

News flash-I came here to be waited on and get a new phone. Not hear about these guys personal lives. I wasn't even acknowledged as I walked into the store. 

I guess I don't get it. Where I work I keep my business to myself and I employ the tactic of multi tasking- not standing around discussing personal matters because whatever system that sets up phones was going slow.

It took them over an hour to tell me that activating my phone likely wouldn't happen today. I left immediately after. 

I won't be back-at least not the Middleton location. No way. No how. I totally get why they had an employee quit 3 days ago and another one call in sick. I'd quit or call in sick too if I worked here.

The class registration queues seemed unorganised and long, and we weren't told when we came that we had to book for the classes which was frustrating to say the least!

Although he was great, the event staff weren't very friendly and were not organised about or receptive to giving out samples of these top chefs' work. They did let us sample the great seafood dish from Iggs but with the chef from Hotel Missoni they let some people sample the pumpkin rissoto (understandable that they were concerned about allowing samples for the fish) but then took the rissoto dish away and tisked those of us still waiting for samples. I wasn't very impressed by the staff. 

Considering this was a paid event, most of the stalls in the main event exhibition hall were a bit stingy in selling food and not giving very many samples, which was a bit sad. They also didn't have that good deals in selling their things. The Edinburgh Gin was apparently reduced down to £17 for a mid-sized bottle, but a quick google search shows that is the same price that Royal Mile Whiskies sells it for. Oh well.

The atmosphere inside is sort of like a 12 year old girl's bedroom, but less cozy. There also aren't any chairs inside, making eating your yogurt there slightly awkward. But the biggest problem is that this place just isn't all that good. There are only a few flavors, and since they sell their yogurt by size and not by ounce, getting toppings can be a bit tricky. They'll fill your medium cup and then there won't be room for the strawberries and brownie bites that you want on top. When we went most of our toppings ended up on the counter. Very disappointing. Plus it was just a little bit too pricy for what they give you.

We figured we could cool off with some frozen yogurt (I refuse to call it ""froyo"") and sit around in the AC for a while.

I wasn't sure which flavor I wanted when I went in; I asked about the tangy one and the girl described it with some assistance from the other person behind the counter, but never offered a sample. I ended up with the Snickerdoodle, which was good but tasted essentially like eggnog (i.e. nutmeg, not cinnamon). I am, in general, not a fan of stuff either in or on my frozen dairy products, so it was unadorned. The texture was great, and the taste was amazing, too -- just not really quite as labeled. If I were going to put toppings on this flavor, I'd go with raspberries, honey and cinnamon sugar. That'd be pretty tasty.

Sadly, the atmosphere is pretty lacking. The AC was barely running, so my frozen treat was melting fast while I was standing at a table to eat. They could really do with some chairs in there. The girls at the counter were more interested in chatting about whether the one should go on a date with that guy with the tattoos than paying attention to us.

Given the ambiance/lack thereof, I'd say it seems a little overpriced. The yogurt was good, but not THAT good. I haven't tried Razzy Fresh but I'd go there first before returning to Sweetlix.","3TRpWYsF04VLf5y2lk5b4w",3,"2011-09-12",0,"review",0

Wir wollten spontan in Waiblingen essen gehen und ich erinnerte mich an einen Zeitungsberricht von der Eröffnung des Mang vor einigen Monaten/Jahren...also gegoogelt...gefunden...hingefahren. Es waren nur 6 Tische belegt und wir hatten freie Auswahl. Man empfahl uns einen Tisch auf der oberen Ebene, alles war gut. Speise- u. Getränkekarte kamen sofort. Wir orderten grünen Tee mit frischem Ingwer und ein Flasche 0,5 ltr. ""Edelwasser""...blaue Flasche heimisches Wasser zu edlem Preis.
Bedienung
Die Chefin bedient selbst, sehr aufmerksam und bestimmt. Für meinen Geschmack ist Ihr Blickkontakt und Augenaufschlag etwas viel...Später fiel mir auf, mit welch affektiertem Gehabe ein Gruppe ""prominenter"" Gäste verabschiedet wurde.
Das Essen
Wir bestellten als Vorspeise einmal die Sommerrolle, gebratenes Hühnchen in Tashi-Curry sowie die knusprige Ente in vietnamesischer Kokossauce. Die Rollen waren sehr klein und enthielten nur flaue Glasnudeln mit sehr wenig Kräutern und einer hauchdünnen Garnelenscheibe. Auch der Hoisin-Sauce fehlte der Pfiff. Diese Rollen kenne ich viel besser, mache sie seit einem Vietnam-Kochkurs auch selber.Die Currys waren beide sehr schmackhaft. Alle zutaten sehr frisch, nichts verkocht und die Sauce schön sämig.Das Entencurry war etwas sehr knapp bemessen, ebenso der Reis zu den Gerichten. Damit stimmt das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis leider nicht ganz.
Das Ambiente
Das Ambiente ist sehr ansprechend, wirkt beruhigend und stimmungsvoll. Kein asiatischer Plastik-Kitsch usw. Wir fühlen uns sehr wohl..

Hat man etwa trotz gelungenem Umbau am Abluftsystem gespart, obwohl im Gastraum hinter einer Glasscheibe gekocht wird? Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich und flink, dafür aber der Rotwein entschieden zu warm. Das Essen war schmackhaft, die Portionen sind überschaubar. Außer der Rechnung von gut 50 € gab es zum Abschied nichts. Auffalend war, dass manche Gäste beim Bezahlen Pflaumenwein serviert bekamen, andere wiederum nicht. Das entscheidet wohl das Los, macht aber keinen guten Eindruck. Die Inneneinrichtung ist modern und ansprechend. Was uns nicht gefiel, war der Kantinencharakter des großen Raumes der zu eng mit Tischen zugestellt war. Etwas mehr Abstand zu den Tischnachbarn und ein paar Abtrennungen bzw. Nischen wären angebracht. Wen das nicht stört, für den ist das Mang sicher eine willkommene Abwechslung.","3GZ4bsAp15Cn75ZaiLZNOw",4,"2008-05-27",0,"review",0

Als wir reingekommen sind, sah alles sehr nobel aus. Die Gäste wurden alle freundlich begrüßt und wir haben gleich einen freien Tisch bekommen (ohne Reservierung). Die Bedienungen (sowohl weiblich als auch männlich) waren sehr sympatisch und locker. Die Getränke kamen nach der Bestellung schnell an den Tisch.

Das Essen war dann auch einige Minuten (vielleicht 10 min) später am Tisch. Meine Freunde und ich, wir waren sehr erstaunt über das Ambiente und das angenehme Gefühl während des Essens, auch der Geschmack war wirklich außergewöhnlich. Nach dem Essen wurden wir noch auf einen Pflaumenwein eingeladen. Dannach haben wir die Rechnung kommen lassen (4 Personen knapp 50EUR). Selbstverständlich gab es Trinkgeld für das Personal. Anschließend haben wir uns bedankt und wurden freundlich verabschiedet. So sind wir dann angenehm gesättigt nach Hause gegangen. 


Im Großen und Ganzen ist das MANG sehr empfehlenswert. Zwei Kleinigkeiten könnten vielleicht noch verbessert werden. Einmal Soft-Drinks gibt es nur in 0,3L Gläsern, diese könnten vielleicht größer ausfallen. Ansonsten könnten die Gerichte ein bisschen mehr Schärfe vertragen (das ist meine Meinung), aber ich denke es sind nur einige Kleinigkeiten. ;)

Ich hoffe, dass meine Kritik hilfreich war und der eine oder andere sich bei Gelegenheit dazu entschließt auch mal das Restaurant zu testen und hier eine Bewertung zu schreiben.

Meine Bestellung: 
Rote Curry Soße mit Rind, Gemüsekombination des Hauses und Reis als Beilage. 

Kostenfaktor: 13,50 € - ein hoher preis für den ersten Eindruck der Menge des Gerichts. Jedoch ist der Preis bei meinem lieblings Thai fast der gleiche.

Nach dem Essen kann ich sagen, dass ich normal bis gut gesättigt war. Also ist die Menge ausreichend.
Positiv überrascht war ich vom Chilli, den ich mir extra dazu bestellt hatte. Gute Schärfe ohne Beigeschmack wie z.B. beim Sambal Olek oder ähnliche scharfe Soßen, die man bei Asiaten aus dem Spender bekommt.

An sich war das Essen gut, jedoch kommt die Soße und somit das ganze Gericht nicht ganz an die fünf Sterne vom ""Thai Garden"" in Schorndorf (20 min. von Waiblingen).

Als Variante ganz gut aber nicht das Beste für schleckige Feinschmecker der Asiatischen Küche.

Dr Shapiro fixed my initial coccyx problem over several months but I found I liked how I felt after an appointment with him.  He also fixed a reoccuring knee problem by analyzing my gait and getting me into some custom designed shoe inserts.

I came across an ad for this place a few days ago at my hairdresser and went to try it today. I was like a kid going up and down the aisles, putting hard to find items like salt fish, sorrel, kola champagne, jerk seasoning, plantain chips and ovaltine biscuits into my basket. It was such a treat to find Caribbean groceries that I had to order online before I knew of Caribbean Market Place. It is a small store but take your time going through...I was surpised at the selection.

After chatting with the lady who rang me up, I learned that the Caribbean Market Place grocery store has been there for 6 years, but they recently opened the kitchen which is adjacent. There are a couple of tables inside and outside, but we opted for an order to go. A generous plate of curry chicken, rice and peas and plantains was $10, oxtail stew with the same sides was $13. VERY good meal! My curry chicken was enough for lunch and dinner...my Dad enjoyed his oxtail with plantains.

We will definitely be back!","7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ",5,"2014-02-02",3,"review",1

You can call ahead and they will reserve space for you or you can always get takeout.

They have a wonderful market next door with lots of different spices and goodies. Miss Gloria is always available if you have any questions.

I took that as a good sign because the food must be real good if people are willing to wait. I ended up waiting more than 15 - 20 minutes by the time my order was taken; which was okay because I wasn't in a rush. I was just happy to finally get my hands on some Jamaican food again being that it's so scarce out here. I ordered a plate of oxtails, rice and peas with plantains. First thing that surprised me was the price, $15 for the plate and a bottled drink was $2.25. But, I didn't worry about that since I was hungry and looking forward to eating some real food. Well, by the time I sat down to eat it was a bit underwhelming. Being that I'm originally from Brooklyn, NY I have had many plates of Jamaican food in my lifetime and this one just didn't quite cut it for me. The portion size was good, but it just wasn't as tasty as the previous reviews made it out to seem. It's possible that this was just an off day so I may go back and try one of their other dishes.","7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ",3,"2016-04-05",0,"review",0

If you find yourself straying westward one afternoon, stop for lunch at the Caribbean Marketplace on 44th Av & W Northern.  The restaurant is expanding to include more dining space.  I am rooting for it's success.  With expansion, I'm hoping to see more organization and a better use of the displays. 

Overall friendly atmosphere; nice ambiance in the restaurant with music to keep rhythm to.  I'm fond of the tall wood tables and chairs.  They add class to the cheap looking tile floor.  The grill outside was hot, but empty so I presume they only grill upon order. 

The grocery store is small with a few packed aisles.  I saw a bit of everything.  If you need something - ask.  Numerous folks came through to pick up one or two things or just out of curiosity, so this spot is pulling in a good crowd. 

Meanwhile, back in the restaurant, I was happy to have a tall serving of homemade sorrel.  Oh yes, yes, that takes me back....Prepared to wait for the snapper (made to order) I also enjoyed a veggie patty of corn, carrots, and cabbage.  It was the classic veggie patty that I remembered from my other life.  

What I wasn't happy about was the lack of green vegetation on the menu.  Oxtails, chicken, goat, patties (beef, chicken, veggie), coco bread, plantains (way too oily!), rices & peas, pasta salad, and potato salad were readily available.  Where were the greens, callaloo, okra?

Nonetheless, my order of snapper was beautifully prepared with bell peppers and onions.  Yummy.  The cook allowed the veggies to flavor the dish and did not rely on a heavy hand of salt.  I will def come to the Caribbean (1 R, 2 B's) Marketplace again and I do recommend that you stop by too.

Let me know start, the place is located in a small strip mall and wasn't hard to find with my GPS.  The sign outside was large enough to see from far.  
Parking is more than generous.  The outside of the establishment is clean.  

As you enter, I was greeted by the friendly employees.  On the left is the grocery side and on the right is the restaurant side with some tables and chairs for eating.

On this particular visit, we found everything we were looking for that couldn't be found at any local grocery store, Walmart, or Target.  We picked up curry and saffron powder, cooking butter, a soft drink called 'Solo', poulourie mix, and a jar of mango chutney all produced in our homeland - Trinidad and all reasonably priced may I add!

While we were there, we figured we'd grab a bite to eat so I ordered the regular curry goat which comes with 2 sides so I chose the rice and beans along with the fried plantains which was very tasty and served hot!  Thankfully the curry goat wasn't too spicy.  The regular is $`13 and was enough for two or maybe if you leave any leftovers, it can go for dinner tonight but I consumed it all.
One of the food items we came for was roti but they were out but will be retuning in a couple days for it....it's a must have!

We were really pleased to have found this place through the internet and Yelp and seeing as they carry many of the products that are so hard to find in our local neighborhood markets and groceries, we will definitely be returning, not just for that roti, but for many other grocery items!","7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ",5,"2014-08-07",4,"review",4

ABER: wer einmal in eine Maultasche dieses Ladens gebissen hat, wird keine anderen Maultaschen mehr mögen. Das Rezept (wie auch der Laden) scheint von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben worden zu sein, und an beidem hat sich seit Anbeginn der Zeit nichts geändert. In ersterem Fall ist das auch gut so.

In fact, if you have tried Nia and didn't love it, I recommend trying another teacher or more.  It's more about the right fit for you than it is about ""good"" and ""bad"" teachers.

So, Jenn Hicks.  She's amazing.

She's not shy about sharing her personal story online and the struggles that lead her to Nia.  She has a passion for mental health and celebrating the bodies we have.  Jenn understands and loves it when you take care of yourself, so there is no pressure to keep up or do anything that doesn't feel right.  

If I need to slow a move down, or take a break, I know that Jenn respects and encourages that.  I feel like she creates a safe place where I can show up, as I am, and dance from there.  All of me is welcome here.

You can be gentle.

That said, if I wanted to pump things up and really work it, there is no one better than Jenn Hicks.  That girl has more energy than anyone I know.  She has a blast while she teaches and her enthusiasm is contagious. 

If you want a great workout that rocks your cardio while being kind to your body, this is the class.  If I could describe her classes in two words, sexy and sweaty come to mind.  The kind of sexy that is barefoot and strong.

I often laugh out loud in her classes as well.  And I love the music she chooses.  It's all over the place, but always fun.

As a meat eater myself, it took some convincing by my wife to try O'Bol, which is a 100% vegan restaurant with no animal products whatsoever.

After tasting their Californian salad however, I was truly impressed! The blend of vegetables with ""simulated"" chicken strips that tasted so much better than some real meat strips, topped with a peanut sauce that marries itself so well to the Asian flavours... It was a piece of heaven!

I've returned only once since then as it's out of my regular way and tucked in the Bonaventure Plaza's food court, but just writing this review right now makes me crave for more.

"2497",3,"IM6ss5QP852np0C4Ponv2g","NLQnEAOKhaXUWCUV4FyxOg","I just read the last review about O'Bol and then snuck out of the office and headed over there, looking for a healthy-ish meal. I'm not vegan, but I've always been a sucker for simulated meats. You can imagine how shocked I was when I got there and saw things like ROAST CHICKEN LEG and MEATBALLS on the menu. Talk about doing a complete 180 on your original concept.

But since I went all the way over there, and nothing else in that food court appealed to me, and I'm not even vegan and therefore have no dietary restrictions, I decided that I was going to eat O'Bol anyway.

I went with the french chicken (I think that's what it was called), which was basically a chicken stew with peas and squash, served in a bowl over rice and roasted potatoes. I also had a squash soup. The verdict? It was pretty good for a food court kiosque, and even though it wasn't what I was expecting, I wasn't really disappointed. It's kind of nice to eat something relatively healthy in a food court (and I mean that in comparison to all the other very greasy and oily things you might be forced to eat in this kind of setting).

It's probably about as homey as you can get in a food court.

Anyway, I think I've gone past the legal limit of the amount of times you can repeat the term ""food court"" in one review, so I'll stop here. But if you're near Bonaventure, and the idea of deciding which mediocre lunch option will leave you the least depressed, do head on over to O'Bol.","BH30SUqfbOlhGpncCsONKg",3,"2011-12-01",3,"review",2

As my friends and I (all of still us hungover at 4 p.m.) walked under the daze of the mid-afternoon sun, coffee seemed like a necessity and SexxPresso seemed like just the quirky (and indeed only) thing we needed.

Tittering, we perused a small wall of shabby nylon lingerie, patent leather (a.k.a. cheap vinyl) bondage gear, and glow-in-the-dark dildos before walking up to the counter, where a scruffy, middle-aged, not unobese guy in a yellowed white tee (or was it a wifebeater) greeted us. 

Bemoaning the state of the economy and the prudence of Vegas tourists nowadays, he took our orders. Behind him, a hipless bottle blonde who looked like she was 12 years old (this is not to imply that the employees at this business are not of age; she just looked that way for sure) fumbled her way around the machinery, ultimately producing our steaming cups with downcast eyes and a flourish of limp synthetic lace.

I forget the name of what I ordered, but I guarantee you that the title was unironically smutty. Back in the daylight, I took an awkward and slightly guilty gulp of cherry-infused mocha. There was nothing wrong with the temperature or the quality of it, but for some reason, I kept thinking about flavored lube and worrying that it was the secret ingredient. Right then, my cocky male coffee connoisseur friend, the only one who could have potentially enjoyed this whole scene, aptly expressed everyone's feelings - ""BLAAAAAGH! You CAN'T mix SEX with COFFEE, man...now all I feel like is that I'm drinking that 12-year-old girl's ASSSSS...tasting her ASSSSSS....""

We walked the rest of the way in depressed silence and got our blood flowing with the Stratosphere rides instead. I want to wish this severely undervisited place luck, but unfortunately, a coffee-cum-sex-shop is not neither a turnon nor a picker-upper, especially not on the dead part of the Vegas strip.","3r2e67holZG6QjiWnKxqjg",2,"2010-06-29",1,"review",3

Oh, yeah, and there was a old(er) guy with salt-and-pepper hair (and a beard to match) who actually had to make the drinks, because the scantily-clad girls (one in a bustier and garter belt, one in a baby doll, and one in a bra and panties -- don't they know steamed milk can be HOT???) didn't know how to make a straight espresso, let alone something as complicated as a latte!

They scheduled to come into our office the day before Labor day and since I was going on vacation I had to make the lunch trek to their office. As to why they planned it that particular day I have no idea...let's make it so as many people are not in the office as possible.

I get there at my reserved time and the place is slammed...as in, I had to stand for almost a half-hour after my allotted time. I almost felt bad for the people who didn't make an appointment  because they were left standing much longer than I and they got there first technically. 

The lady who took my blood poked and prodded the needle for an excessive amount of time in search of a vain, after I squirmed in pain and asked what she was doing she said she had to do it again in my other arm...fabulous. Now after all of this it was time to take my blood-pressure..yipppee!

As you can imagine it had sky-rocketed by that point so I requested we wait a minute and take it again as I knew I didn't have high BP and this was due to stress, clearly. We are also able to take two other readings if our first is high. She was visibly annoyed at my request and then said she couldn't record the reading in the machine -after a few minutes of explanation from myself she finally gave in and put her signature by hand next to my lower reading.

Then I spent the next two months back and forth with Quest and my employer as they submitted my higher reading resulting in me not qualifying for a discount.

Maybe it was the atmosphere, quiet on a week night, no great atmosphere or lively vibe, felt like there were more servers watching than serving with patrons coming in and out from time to time. There is actually a larger dining room at the end of a narrow corridor, which was.... empty.

Drinks start at $13, and they are tasty, well crafted, with much time and effort. They do not list the prices on the menu and I'm guessing the fancier ones do come at an even steeper cost. but I'm not good with names, so I wouldn't even know which ones are for the high rollers.

Their menu comes in a few categories, starting with ""bite size"" snacks, which 2/3 were sold out at the time. There are salads flatbreads and a few mains to add to it, and specials rhymed off by the waitor. The special was a fish (can't remember what), with apple and horseradish puree and root veg. Sounded enticing enough as the flavours seemed bold and interesting. When it came out, I must have misinterpretted that the horshradish came separately but it must have been mixed in with the apple puree, which really tasted like applesauce, no horse radish evident. The root vegetables were bright and beautiful, but it had no flavour to it. The fish was small sear, and for the same price, I had two fillets at Gusto 101. I thought it was a little too salty, and overcooked. Overall, not impressed with the price or quality.

My friends who got the carbonara with light cream sauce thought it was okay, but the portions looked a little small. The vegetarian flat bread, at first looked like sausage, but in fact wasn't and tasted nothing like I thought - much too salty than preferred. 

It is always because of good company that I will stay at a sub-par restaurant for 3 hours. I wouldn't mind coming for a late night drink if other places were packed, but I felt this environment was a little too stuffy for me.

What she doesn't put in her review is she is a renter.  She is not making decisions on what work is done on the pool.  The owners do.  I did everything I was paid to do, AND more.  She threatened me with a bad review if I didn't do all the extra work the owners opted out of.  She called at all hours of the night and on weekends making unreasonable demands like a service call on a Sunday because she wasn't familiar with the equipment, didn't know how to turn a feature on.   The way she treated me and my staff, like ""the help"" was totally uncalled for.   I had been servicing that pool for 5+ years for quite a few other tenants, with no issues.   When Kelly moved in, the issues began immediately.   Kelly F. needs to learn how to treat service companies.

I know Rascal House pizza is terrible-- weird, sweet crust reminiscent of bisquick, sweet sauce, tasteless toppings.  It was one of three places to eat on Euclid whilst I was taking my Bar Review at CSU (not as fun as it sounds-- bar exam review, not a review of bars).  The other two were an Arby's and a scary greasy spoon.  So I ended up having at Rascal House more times than I care to count.  Imagine having to study for the most important test of your life AND having to eat bad pizza along with it.  The horror.  The horror.

I've had it since then, because downtown firms always seem to order it for working lunches.  It has not improved.

So, here I am, back at CSU to take a few classes.  What to have for lunch.  I'm pretty sick of Subway.  Nothing at the school food service looks good today.  What to get?  A salad.  How hard can a salad be?  Surely Rascal House has a simple, tasty salad.  Most  pizza places do.

Swamp water.  That's what it tasted like.  The lettuce bore the unmistakeable taste of pre-cut, bagged lettuce that had been siting in the cooler for a while until someone opend it and dumped it into a container without washing it.  (I worked at a few dives to put myself through undergrad.  I know how that works.)  The carrot shreds were completly dry and had absorbed whatever scary odors were going around the cooler.  The turkey and ham were both of the ultra processed, parts-is-parts variety. there was about a tablespoon of cheese and two tiny slices of hard boiled egg.  Sad.

THEN, I had to eat it whilst listening to really bad, really loud 1980s top 40.   No Cure, no Depeche Mode.  1980s Hambone music.

Wildmanwood is as good as any of the pizza's I've had in the capital. I'm giving it the full 5 stars because I really liked it and I hope it does well.

I love the branding and the feel of the place. It feels modern, a bit hipster and especially in the midst of festival season it had a bit of a buzz. A lot of other pizza places go for a more rustic homely Italian feel, so I quite liked the contrast here.

It's not a huge venue and it's made up of long large tables - you will be sitting next to other dining companions. It's an informal and fun place, I'd come with some friends but it might not be ideal if you are planning an intimate romantic dinner. 

The menu has a lot of good variety. A lot of other places have a lot of very similar sounding pizzas, whereas they was a good mix of tomato-based and white pizzas here with a variety of interesting toppings. I had 'The Donald' - with tallegio, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, sausage. I enjoyed it a lot and I definitely wanted to come back to try some of the other options. Washed it all down with one of my favourite beers, a Beavertown IPA. Pizzas were all around about the £10 mark.

So, here is my sad tale of how you should never treat a customer. 

I was going to a circle k store and getting the 85 cent sodas for a while. 

Months ago DIANNE from green Valley grocery had me confused over the size of a soda refill and I gladly paid what she wanted. 

Well, for. The last two weeks I was refilling the same circle k cup at Green Valley grocery for 85 cents until DIANNE informed me that the price was $1.29. 

Embarrassed I mentioned that I had been getting the 85 cent price for the last few weeks, the same as circle k but I could do it closer to home. 

I told her that I only had around $1.10 on me but could she give me a pass this time? 

DIANNE replied that ""I'll take whatever you have in your pocket this time you get your 'pass' but the manager says to watch out for you and that you do this all the time!"" 

I have never been so damn offended at a convenience store. Ever ever. 

Over what amounted to a nineteen cent difference, that she would likely have left on her counter through her shift. 

They have permanently lost my business. No matter what I need, I'll never return.","7ZPMngvH89iNF0RzFiIEqw",1,"2014-04-18",2,"review",0

The dessert is accompanied with fruit and other sundries. No returned dishes, and well informed staff.

We were certainly surprised when we arrived with our kids to dirty looks from most. We asked how long the wait would be and the man said at least 45 minutes but no promises, it could be much longer. Since we didn't know where else to go in the city and had trekked all the way there with our three kids we said we would wait. I guess they realized they were not getting rid of us that easily and miraculously 5 minutes later there was a table for us. 

The waiter was much nicer and accommodating to our family. He split a dish on to two plates for our kids and put tomato sauce on the side as requested by them. My steak was mediocre. For the size of the steak, about half of it was fat. I would have been more impressed with a small piece of quality steak rather than a gigantic one that you couldn't eat a lot of. 

All in all, I would not recommend this to families unless you have teenagers that will quietly sit and eat dinner.

The menu is clearly displayed above the counter, although they have a few more dishes on their takeaway menu if nothing above stands out for you. I ordered a Wazeeri Kabob Dinner.

The food took some time to prepare; maybe ten minutes, wasn't timing it. I imagine they do not do a lot of pre-cooking. I don't mind that at all, but don't expect fast-food service times. As long as the food is good, I think the preparation time was reasonable.

What I got was a fair size salad, which tasted fresh and clean, and I enjoyed. The rice was a sort of pilaf with raisins and cooked shredded carrots, which was fine. I'm not keen on cooked raisins in rice, but it's definitely something lots of people enjoy, so I'll withhold my judgement.

The chicken kabob was the star of the plate. Chicken kabobs are usually cooked to death, dry and unappetizing. This kabob managed to be moist without being undercooked, with slight charring on the corners (pleasantly so). Both kabobs were spiced enough to be interesting without being so spicy that you couldn't really taste the meat. The shami kabob was a nice beef kabob as well, although the chicken kabob really stood out for me.

I also had three pieces of their afghani naan in a little basket. Their naan is clearly popular, I've seen lots of people leaving their attached bakery with armloads of naan bread. I like it well enough, it's hearty, tastes like whole wheat, and well-cooked, but given the choice I'd probably be happier with white puffy indian-style naan. Still, it's good.

It was a bit too much food for me, and I'm a reasonably big eater. I didn't have any trouble finishing it, but it was more than I needed for lunch. The next time around, I'll probably skip the rice, because it was my least favorite part of the meal anyway.

The service was solid, although unexceptional.

I went to Afghan Village once in their older location in the same mall, and it didn't really stand out for me. This visit was something else entirely. I can see from the other reviews that some other people had less pleasing experiences than I did, and I haven't been there often enough to know which experience is more common. However, I will definitely be returning, and perhaps after a few more visits, I'll be able to speak to their consistency.","-Ag1PS0_G0yGxLWv_pULiA",4,"2013-10-01",0,"review",0

The salad was somewhat disappointing, didn't seem fresh and really soggy. The main highlight was the chicken breast kabob which was outstanding, perfectly seasoned and flavoured, and very tender. The whole wheat naan bread was lightly toasted and pretty fresh for that time of night.

It was awesome. Three of us went for dinner a couple days ago and we all left stuffed, satisfied and excited to return. The menu is predominately kabobs, meat, and I saw one lamb curry on the back page. 

Two of us sampled the chicken kabob dish and the third person a chicken and beef kabob platter. The meat was succulent, spiced well and flavourful. The dish came with rice that had shaved carrots and raisins which was tasty , a side of salad and amazing nan. 

I noticed people kept coming in the restaurant while we were waiting for our food and leaving with bags of nan to go. The nan at Afghan Village is not like Indian nan, it's whole wheat, a big long oval shape and doughy. Very tasty with our starter (can't remember the name). Although we couldn't breathe we were so stuffed, we had tea and sampled their baklava (a lighter, not overly sweet baklava). I would 100% return for dinner to Afghan village. While the decor is nothing to write home about, the wait staff were really friendly and explained dishes and took an interest that we were in the restaurant. 

On a side note, the restaurant has a small ""retail"" store at the front by the door that carries food products, desserts, nuts and tea from Afghanistan.  Cool place.

The focus is on a ""zen relaxed"" atmosphere, with brick oven pizza and nuances of Asian cuisine (mostly the sides) peppering the menu. 

Atmosphere/Ambiance A - It's trendy casual. Interior is Asian themed with splashes of Asian art on the walls and ceiling. (Love the dragon painted beam) The dining area is small 5 tables of two on each side. You can easily rearrange seating for 2 or more. The middle there's a longer high top table for larger parties. There is also seating in the small bar area at back of restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, Easy Rock tunes (Brown Eyed Girl) was playing in the background.  No TV's though. Still it's a nice place for lunch or stop by after work and chill in the small bar area kind of joint.

I had the Ho-Tai(The Happy Buddha)  which was artichoke hearts, spinach, cherry tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. The crust was baked perfect, NY style, not super thin crust though. The ingredients fresh and good quality. The sauce was evenly distributed on pizza. It didn't overpower the cheese and veggies. I enjoyed the pizza.  It made me happy.

Thin strips of tender white chicken and napa cabbage,and rice noodles, the vinaigrette used was perfect for me, just slightly sweet and not too tangy and evenly tossed in the salad. I will most likely come here just to have this salad for lunch next time.  Along with the Japanese pretzel sticks.  Those were different. Tiny pretzel sticks with garlic infused chili oil to dip. 
 
Prices are in the moderate range, I didn't see any lunch hour or happy hour specials.
  
Service A+ - Friendly and efficient. For being open just a few days, service far out exceeded my expectations.  My server was knowledgeable about menu items and was able to answer my questions. The owner Mark also came by and followed up and chatted with me. He takes great pride and rightfully so with his new place.  Loves everything about Hawaii and the shave ice served here is inspired by Matsumoto's.  It's not quite like shave ice from the 808, but nice attempt with the Azuki (sweet red beans) and vanilla ice cream.

The other fun touches....The Wish Book! When you are presented with your check at the end, you get a Smartie candy and a little booklet where you get to write your wish and insert it in the wish keeper that's displayed in the middle of dining area.

The truth about Pizza Buddha?  It's a new pizza joint that opened last month in Henderson and I love it!  It's not a very big place, but it packs a lot of punch, just like Pacquiao (except he got knocked out decisively after dinner, but I digress).  Before the Big Fight, my friend and I had dinner at PB and thoroughly enjoyed our first visit.  I say first because we'll definitely be back.  The name of the restaurant may lead one to believe that they serve some kind of weird Asian pizza combinations, but it's not like that, my friends.  There exists a Buddhist theme to the place, from the Asian decor to the names of the menu items, but the specialty pizzas are creative, not Asian, per se.  My date and I chose to create our own and settled on a large mushroom, pancetta, and shaved garlic pizza.  We ordered the PB Egg Rolls appetizer to start, which were 3 large egg rolls filled with ricotta and spinach.  Served steaming hot with a side of marinara sauce, they were tasty and I told our waiter he should have brought us 4 so we didn't have to split the 3rd one.  Our pizza arrived not too long after and we both agreed it was Buddha-licious, not greasy at all with a good-karma inducing crust and soul-soothing sauce.  I had two slices because I wanted to leave room for the dessert, shaved ice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, azuki beans, and your choice of root beer, orange, or cherry flavor.  We chose the root beer and this would be my only gripe about the evening:  there was not enough root beer for all the shaved ice, as more than half of it was just ice with none of the root beer.  Don't order the dessert expecting Snow Ono-quality.  Our bill was served with Smarties candy and a Wish book for each of us to write down a wish and place it in the Wish Maker near the entrance.  Our waiter was fantastic, helpful in terms of the menu and attentive throughout the entire meal, genuinely positive and friendly.  My wish for you is that you get yourself to Pizza Buddha and enjoy the experience as we did.  Peace out.","0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A",4,"2012-12-09",0,"review",3

Went last night with friends for dinner, who tried it out earlier this week. 

Great variety of appetizers that you wouldn't find in your typical pizza place, or 
chinese restaurant. Nope, these were unique combinations of cheese, meat or vegetables that are an explosion of flavor. 

We had the mozzarella squares & mushroom sliders for appetizers. 
The mozzarella was topped with pesto sauce and tomatoes. Great flavor, however it was served warm to cold, not hot.
Now to the mushroom sliders, one of the best appetizers I have ever had.. Portabello mushroom grilled and topped with pickled vegetables and an asian sweet sauce served on a soft bun. 2 per order.. They should do 3 or 4 with a side and serve it as an entree... So good..you want more.. 

We ordered a cheese pizza for the kids and a pepperoni & sausage for the adults. 
Thin crust pizza with a tasty tomato sauce, cheese, sausage and I like the way they do the pepperoni, its in thin strips and not cut in circles. Both delicious

The combinations of the specialty pizzas sounded great, and I can't wait to try one on my next visit.

Being able to resurrect heirloom vegetables is not only trending but it's being part of the greater interest in growing and eating locally grown foods that are revolutionizing our culinary scene. Many local restaurants are buying farmers market produce. 

The real secret to growing is water and living earth. This should not be confused with hose water and dirt. Learning about modern growing techniques such as brewing tea, Alaskan compost, guano, microorganisms in the living soil and amendments will give you bigger and healthier yields.

 Die Curry war, nunja Standart. Soviel kann man da nun auch nicht anders machen. Leider war das Ketchup recht sauer, was den Geschmack etwas getrübt hat.


 Das Putenschnitzel war nicht zu trocken, aber auch nicht zu saftig. Einfach genau richtig (ich hab auch mal abgebissen).


 Zum Essen werden aufgebackene, und in unserem Fall, warme Brötchen gereicht. Sowas mag ich. Auch Preislich ist alles in einem gut Bezahlbaren rahmen.

I immediately liked the decor and ambiance at Oh Burger, and as a party of two we seated ourselves at a little table to the left of the bar.  The restaurant was not incredibly busy but busy enough that most tables and a few bar stools were accounted for. 

The waitress was very friendly, our order was taken and the drinks arrived quickly.  Our food was delivered by a very personable man whom we assumed was the manager.

I had the 8oz bison burger with mushrooms, a side of fries and Sapporo (a damn good Japanese beer!).

Overall it took almost 20min to get my food.  

I ordered the classic w/ cheese combo w/ fries.  I found the burger to be a bit dry and chewy.  Definitely not juicy. The fries were soggy - they were definitely not fresh from the fryer.  The onion rings were just the way I like - battered not breaded and super crispy.

the back room is hella impressive (check the photo of the bar) and they have a jukebox machine that plays music videos throughout the bar (as a musicvideo junkie this is more than impressive). my roomate told me the owner got him and a bunch of friends drunk one night, I guess this happens a lot because we did free shots with our hot waitress (Monday at 7pm). 

lotta beers on tap, this is definitely the kind of place to meet up weekend late night with some hungry friends and chow down/get hammered ($11 pitchers). apparently they're starting to do live music too.

They started off strong amongst the slowly crowding burger scene in Toronto and kinda died off. I'm not sure if it's simply the sheer number of new places always popping up or if quality has gone down since the doors first opened.

From the few times I've been, they have been pretty consistent.  I mean their burgers have never been the best as they would have liked to proclaim or the early reviewers would have suggested.  On this occasion I dropped by Oh Boy with Angela for lunch. I ended up ordering the cheese burger combo for just 9.95. I upgraded and got the sweet potato fries and onion rings with an iced tea. I topped it with the traditional toppings with ketchup and mayo. Angela got a Hawaiian burger with an iced tea.  She also opted for the traditional toppings with ketchup.

Now the burger is a solid burger. It's meaty and has a decent flavour to it. I like how it's not overly done so the moisture is still there. The amount of fries and onion rings were huge. I mean I love the portion sizes at oh boy. I come here knowing I'll be hitting a food coma when I'm done.  The sides weren't as strong as it has been in the past.  The crispiness wasn't there for the sweet potato fries and the onion rings were a little worse than their usual.  So definitely a little disappointing and I can see why there's a drop from their initial launch.  Angela liked her burger and like me, felt it was a solid all around burger.  I guess for the both of us it was disappointing to see oh boy go. The place was pretty much a pub which specialized in serving burgers.  They had the bar at the back with flat screens but I guess it just didn't work out in the end.

Overall, I liked oh boy. It's nothing out of the extraordinary, but sometimes all you want is a familiar taste at pretty reasonable prices. I'm a huge believer of leaving a restaurant full. Love that satisfying feeling and knowing that I got a good bang for my buck.  With it closing, I can only hope for another burger joint to take its place.  A place that will also provide a similar feel and bang for my buck. Thank you oh boy, I have always left needing to past out sooner than I think.","1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw",3,"2011-03-04",1,"review",1

It was a  cold night though (my new venturing always seems to happen on cold days) and though I was weary about the fact that there was only a big man sitting in the booth looking outwards and nobody else in the restaurant - I went in for some good ol' pub food.

I had a milkshake and Chorico Burger with poutine as a side(can you believe that?!!), which came to about $15. 
When the milkshake came, I thought , well that's about what it's worth - it turns out there was not enough of the shake, I found myself rationing it so it will last longer. It was GREAT....it wasn't orgasmic, but it was pretty close.

Then our waitress brought us our sides - in a bowl by itself - and I thought OMG if this is the size of ""sides"" I scared about size for meals -  the portions were ENORMOUS for a side - it was more of a meal.
The food came, and it filled the whole table - I barely managed to finish my delicious burger (which I sort of forced to eat by the end, cuz I wasn't leaving none behind) and took my untouched poutine to go.
I believe this is the only time I felt like I was paying too little for the food I was getting - the proportions were like Chinese restaurant proportions - you get $2 worth of food for $1.

Upon entering, one sign told us to go order at the counter which we attmpted only to be redirected to be served at the back of the restaurant.
In the interest of speed, my dining companion and I chose the bar to look forwad to our first foray into what was surely to be one of Toronto's finest burger experiences.

We tried to order a couple of beer, only to be told by our self admittedly hung over waitress that they were ""mostly out"".  We were offered (for free to be fair), the dregs of a keg, and subsequently switched to one of the few beers they had left.

Recommendations were sought from our server - you know for an empty restaurant, she was sure a long time between visits.

I chose the highly recommended three cheese burger, while my companion chose a pure offering, one with fries, one with rings.

The burgers arrived (eventually) with no discussion about how they should be cooked at all...

My process cheese crusted to the top of a greasy, tateless, salt lick accompanied by freezer burnt greasy onion rings was difficult to stomach and required additional beer to get it down.

The natural burger was equally disappointing, and the french fries, soggy and over salted.

There's really not much point in pining on about the other shortcomings.

As we left with our stomachs wanting, our wallets emptier than they should have been, and considerably more time elapsed than reasonable, we couldn't help but wonder:

Finally my boyfriend went up and placed our order at the take-out counter. The employee there apologized and said she would bring us our orders. The orders came but we had to flag her down again to ask for cutlery and napkins.

Living on King St W has his benefits, and usually a burger craving would send us to Craft Burger, good 'ol faithful -- but tonight, we strayed. With great regret ...

It's 7pm. 
Thursday evening. Even though we'd checked this site for reviews (which were scattered at best) we thought we'd give it a go. Mid week, later in the evening. Give it the benefit of the doubt.

The place was still busy. 
But really, just full of a few people sitting-in to eat. We drove there, to check the place out, and place our take-out order in person - less chance of error ... riiiiiiiiight?!?  
The 2 guys behind the counter were talking a lot of sh*it ... which we noticed right off when we walked in. They weren't young, but they were extremely 'young' acting, and immature. 
We kinda knew what we were in for, but decided to continue in .. 
 
The 'girl behind the cash' was a mid-aged-overly-made-up blonde girl, who looked lovely, but didn't have much rattling around in her head. 
We placed our orderr: a little oh boy combo (there version of 2 sliders & 1 side (fries) & drink) and a Hog Town Combo (w/fries) and a single order of Onion Rings. 


So, as we're waiting, we watch these 2 guys (I'll call them Griller #1 & Griller #2) huddled behind a very very small work space & exposed grill, that's publically displayed, so we can watch the exciting grilling action - kinda cool, right? 
No, not really. 
Because of the heat, it was just a fogged up mess. 
But after witnessing what little we did, I highly doubt they'll want to advertise what goes on behind there! 

My boyfriend then notices the box of burgers, on the floor. Just sittin' there. 
We then watch, a guy come to pick up his order, and confirm his request of 'NO MAYONNAISE'. Griller #1 behind the counter, then looks at the burger in his hand, that he had just squired a load of mayo on. Noticing his mistake (and the guy who had requested it), he throws the burger to one side, and accepts a 'fresh' burger from Griller #2. And he re-makes his burger. This time with no mayo.
Griller #2 must see potential for resale (!), so he starts scraping the mayo off .. and throws it back on the grill!!!
AHHHHH!!
Griller # 1 & Griller #2 were definite loud mouths - they were swearing, and making fun of how bad their service was - they were joking about drug use *including being under the influence* .. just the weirdest crap I'd ever heard spewing out ... and completely unprofessional. 


We also witnessed them re-frying food.
fries specifically.  
 

Our food was 'ready' - 
So. We never got the single order of onion rings. We didn't notice this until we got home, and inspected our dinner. 
That, after we had watched the one Griller get in 'trouble' from the other Griller, for serving 'too many onion rings' in an order. 
Makes one wonder ...

So, for $32.21 - failed & incomplete order
 .75 cents - 20 minutes of parking, 
Oh Boy! Did we get ripped off.

I can't lay claim to Chris ""burger baron"" P.'s bona fide burger-bonanza breadth, but I've had a few burgers in my time.  This was the best one I can remember.

I was treated well from the minute I walked in the door, which itself took some effort - use the middle door instead of trying and retrying the side ones in front of a crowd (like I did).  Had a good laugh and a warm welcome from two staff waiting on the inside before catching up with waiting friends Kat ""the app for that"" F. and the aforementioned burger baron.

I was greeted by the lovely and charming Vharay who advised on burger selection and beer offerings before provisioning a promptly pulled pint and a business card (as I had suggested that she didn't really have one).  I ordered the Oh Boy Classic with 3 Cheese combo, with a half-and-half fries and onion rings (it's not on the menu, although I think it should be, so don't count on this).  They have Mill Street Tankhouse on tap, and I indulged.  

The burger came OEM with lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and a good slice each of cheddar, swiss and havarti.  Aftermarket options exist, but the stock version sounded good enough already.

And it was.

8 ounces of AAA ground chuck, grilled to perfection and juicier than a Georgia peach in full season.  The guacamole had a creamy texture and flavour that added a high note to the gooey cheesy goodness, yet somehow through all that rich flavour the patty still managed to shine through and remind me why I was there in the first place.  I was in heaven for the three minutes that burger lasted in my hands.

The onion rings were fantastic - just a really well-made, classic ring.  Fries were thin-cut, which Is great for flavour, but they get cold fast (eat them first).  They were also perfectly salted.

Interesting fact:  The walls in the bathroom are painted with blackboard paint.","1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw",5,"2009-11-26",6,"review",5

well for a hefty price like that, it fell very short.  firstly, there was no mill street left.  no one has to go business school or ever work in a restaurant to know that if you dont have it available, DONT ADVERTISE IT.  i had to mention it to them to remove the sign, which they did.  

the waitresses serving me were very nice, patient and understanding.  i settled for a sleemans, which was offered to me at a mere three bucks (here the ""mere"" is meant for real).  I sat and watched silent snippets of a women's hockey game in the olympics on one of the tvs that besieged you as you ate. (are we really that boring to each other?).  now i was in a rush and probably shouldnt have come there in the first place because i had a play to catch.  but i asked them to check on my burger - AAA 8 oz burger with havarti, cheddar, swiss, guacamole, tomato, lettuce - and they did and it came out a minute later - DRY AS A BONE.

i imagine that they are required to cook a burger to a certain doneness for legal reasons or some such, but when you have to load it up with mayo and heinz dijon (low quality for sure) just so you can stomach it, there is a problem.  

i really cant express how tragic it is for me when i pay through the nose for food and it sucks.  they offered me a 15 percent discount card for the next time....i left it there.

im willing to acknowledge that a restaurant, a waitress, a cook can have a bad day, of course, but it is hard to return to a place which f-bombs it up the first time around on something you really could have done brilliantly much better at home, especially when they have the gumption to charge as much as they do - and if you tell me that the AAA prime ground chuck, etc., is the reason the price is up that high, then i say to you if i am supposed to afford that meat the respect it deserves (that already sounds weird, but okay), then you, as the cook better idolize it and make me faint with nirvana the moment after it hits my palate.","1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw",2,"2010-02-16",5,"review",5

There was a couple bits of gruel, it was a little dry and didn't have much flavor, even w/ the cheese. But the sodas had free refills which was nice since it was still warm and humid out.

- Good sized burger, tasty, juicy
- Guac and lots of it! Freshly made.
- Free refills of soft drinks, cool glass coke mugs (I want one...)
- Breakfast burger? They said it's coming in 2010...
- Stout and ice cream :D

Joey's a great guy and we learned some interesting things about him and Oh Boy!

1.  Before starting the Oh Boy! project Joey had hair (picture 80's hair band), but has a head now more resembling Mr. Clean
2.  Joey claims that he's ""old, like really old"", but doesn't look a day over 30.
3.  The Oh Boy! name stems from a diner in Toronto that no longer exists and is going to be a brand that says they're serious about what they do but still have fun doing it.
4.  It took a year to get Oh Boy! up and running due to the building almost falling over and new structural elements needing to be implemented.
5.  Joey picked the Queen Street location to be close to the entertainment district without needing to be in the middle of all the hype of the ED.
6.  Oh Boy! was started to give people a better experience to enjoy a burger.  Joey describes the experience as coming to the restaurant and enjoying premium quality ingredients while hanging out with friends, and grabbing a beer while the game plays in the background.

Upon this return to Oh Boy! I was even more impressed just due to the fact that they have Okanagan Springs on tap.  It was also great to see that they're working through the growing pains and things are coming together for them.

It was nice to see that our server Vharay was genuine in her involment to make sure we had a good experience and had everything we needed.","1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw",5,"2009-11-26",8,"review",4
"2627",2,"gPK2AKr-UA_7hZus80SSng","e8UvZ6gnFbULavsX30hDFg","My opinion of Oh Boy comes from the vegetarian perspective and so, I can't actually say that the huge beef burgers I saw on the grill are better or worse than any other non-chain burger joint.  I got the Portobello burger, which is hopefully the healthiest 'burger' on the menu.  The topping options are all very similar to Hero Burger.  But, the sauces at Oh Boy are all free, including Guacamole!  I thought I had loaded it up with a variety of sauces and toppings, but when it came out it looked kind of puny due to Shrinkage of the 'bello.  The Chipotle BBQ sauce is not very spicy, but is very tasty. The Lettuce is no cheap ice-berg from a bag, it's good quality boston lettuce. 
They have a few kinks to work out, but now is the time to go, because this place is going to get packed. On this First Sunday afternoon, there was hardly any room to sit. The front area is full of booths as is the back. In the middle there are a row of stools to sit on. 
The back bar area is surrounded by TV's showing football and I can see this being a huge thing- bar, bar stools, booths and burgers.  
I also tasted the poutine. The fries are on the small side, which is nice. But the gravy is very beefy and reminds me of the City Hall truck's gravy. This could be a good thing, but it's pretty low on my list of faves in the city.  The food is decent, the atmosphere is wicked and late night line ups are certain. Head there now, just don't get upset that they maybe ran out of half of the stuff on the menu....","1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw",3,"2009-11-22",6,"review",4

I love the decor choices made with this place. Its a nice urban feel, with the kitchen front and centre, with nice booths and some corner tables for groups. 

The burgers didn't disappoint. I had the ""Hog Town"" combo, which included the classic patty along with 2 types of bacon, onion rings, and a drink. I bought a pint of their local ale, which was a perfect compliment. All of it was amazing. I wouldn't change a thing.

My wife had the Oh Boy classic with 3 cheese combo, and she enjoyed it as well. I had a bite, and can attest to the quality. Everything was wonderful with hers too.

I thought for what we got, the price was very fair. The portions were generous. Both of our stomachs were satisfied.

What needs a bit of improvement is the service. Our server was pleasant but a little clueless. What was hilarious was how proud she was that she had remembered to write down the beers on tap, so she could read it back to us. I think she was new to the place, so I'm willing to give her a second chance.

(sigh) The previous reviews just went all over the place and I wasn't so sure what to expect but when my brother burger reviewer Chris P. sang the praises of the beef on a bun at Oh Boy I thought that they would be all that and a bag of chips. 

I had appointments on Camden Street this morning so on my way out I thought I'd grab a burger from Oh Boy and take it for a dance. Trouble was that this burger couldn't even two step and basically had two left feet. I arrived at Oh Boy literally on the nose of noon hoping to beat the lunch rush and ordered up an Oh Little Boy Combo with sweet potato fries. Most of the major complaints I've read about OB's is that they seem to overcook the burgers so I figured if I ordered up the baby burgers and being smaller, they'd spend less time on the grill. Makes sense, right? Ummmmm....apparently not. It took almost 25 minutes before my order finally surfaced. 

So out the door I dash with my lunch bag in hand only to discover ten minutes later that they eff'ed up my order. Wrong kind of cheese on those little sliders. No sweet potato fries but rather regular french fries which were soggy and cold by the time I got to them. As for those little 2 ounce burgers.... well they were pretty much small pieces of carbon on a bun. Did I order blackened burgers? They were dry and crusty and no amount of toppings was going to save these little charred nuggets. 

Someone needs to smack those grill boys with a hot spatula because when you eff up Momma's burger she is gonna be pissed big time. For this shitty bag of baby burgers I forked out $13 bucks. I felt like I'd been hosed. 

The restaurant itself is really cool. It's large and unlike Craft that can seat only about 8 people, the Oh Boy seats about 100 people. I love the bar area and I'm hopeful that eating in the restaurant would yield a much more favorable result. I've still got my discount coupons from the very first time I wandered in and the grill was out of commission. If anyone is interested in using them, let me know, I'm not so sure I'm ready to go back to Oh Boy just yet. 

Afterwards I thought to myself that I should have walked a little further east and gone in to the Leslieville Cheese Store and gotten a grilled cheese for lunch. I would have been a whole lot happier.","1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw",2,"2009-12-05",7,"review",4

I guess the bottom line is that their burgers are no good.... they're not horrible, but they're not good either. 
I ordered a Spicy Boy Combo and despite the burger being clearly cooked to a nice medium inside, it was very dry and black on the outside. Second, the meat lacked any distinctive beefy flavour and was very bland - it was almost like eating frozen patty. I think it's simply due to an inefficient kitchen that doesn't know proper food handling. They also need a better ordering system where burgers and fries are served within 10-15mins. Why should take 30-45 mins to be served? The owners need to make changes otherwise they'll be expecting to close down very soon.","1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw",2,"2010-05-06",1,"review",1

This Subway has a group of employees that wish you would implode in the parking lot before you make it to their door. I'm not expecting someone to hold the door for me, welcome me to the establishment, and take my coat, but do you people really have to be such a bunch of frowny muthas? 

I can't crack a joke, utter a friendly word, or either breathe in the same space as these employees without getting the look of death from any one of them, especially the older guy with grayish hair. He's either a card carrying member of the shortbus, or he's too busy fantasizing about stabbing me repeatedly in a dark alleyway to actually speak to and make eye contact. Maybe he's prone to seizures, I don't know. 

If you go here, and you're even slightly undecided about what kind of bread you want, or what kind of toppings should go on your sandwich you should probably call the PoPo and ask for an escort back to your car.

Since Phoenix has taken over, the best thing about it is that tickets are $6 all day, every day. Tuesday bargain days are $4, as are all tickets for kids and seniors. This theater does show new releases, so you can't beat these prices.

They've re-opened the bar upstairs, and I think there's food. I haven't tried it yet, but plan to soon.

It was Destinta at one point, and also had another name before that but I can't remember. Anyways, since my last visit, the building has added a trampoline park, which has the same entrance as the movie theater. Today, my husband and I went to see The Revenant. The movies are the movies, so here is my simple breakdown...

Pros: 
~All tickets are $6....except on Tuesdays, which is $4. Not bad at all.
~The seats are comfortable and the theater was clean.
~If you had little ones attending a birthday party at the trampoline park (like my niece does all the time at this location), you could - hopefully - keep busy with a movie. There are also two rock climbing walls and arcade type games.

Cons: 
~Bathrooms were gross. Water all over the counters, garbage on the floor, etc. I opened one stall door and apparently the toilet had a leak. I deduced this in part to 1) my fine detective skills and 2) a large clear plastic bag that was over the entire back of the toilet and went into a garbage can filled to the brim with dirty toilet water next to it. Why not just put an ""out of order"" sign up?
~Food and drink prices. Obvious, I know. A medium fountain drink is $4,75, which is just ridiculous. Also, apparently, it is now harder to sneak foodstuff in. There is a sign up at the front door prohibiting bringing in any food or drink and the establishment reserves the right to check your bags. Hmmm I guess the staff was slacking today because they missed my bottled water and bag of pretzels.

All that being said, ticket prices are still cheap. I would return if I found another movie I was interested in seeing.","4bOUHefNIMkOd5VqfpDgrQ",3,"2016-03-02",10,"review",11

They even serve wine and liquor. Can you imagine: drinking a cold one while watching a Marvel superhero movie. Insane idea, but worth a try if you're over 21.

Ein Besuch zum Entspannen ist den ganzen Tag und die ganze Nacht über möglich. Leicht erhöht liegt die Lounge direkt neben einem Teil des Casinos. Die bequemen Sessel und Tische sind rund um eine Wassersäule platziert, die 1.700 gallons Wasser enthält. Und darin schwimmen nicht nur australische Belly Seepferdchen, nach denen die Lounge benannt ist, sondern auch eine Vielzahl anderer Meerestiere und Fische, die die australische Küste bevölkern. Da dieses Aquarium in der Mitte der Lounge liegt, ist freier Blick von allen Plätzen garantiert.

Die Damen, die bedienen, sind leicht geschürzt, weiße (sehr) kurze Röcke und ebenso weiße Corsage. Aber modisch so gar nicht trendig.

In der Lounge werden Getränke aller Art angeboten, vom erfrischenden Kaffee am Morgen bis zu einer Vielzahl an Cocktails. Das Besondere sind jedoch die über 20 Champagnersorten, die in 1/2-Flaschen angeboten werden. Nun gut, wir haben sie nicht probiert, uns reichten beim letzten Besuch ein G&T und ein Tanqueray Cocktail (je $ 11,50+).

Wer nach 22 h die Lounge besucht, wird Betrachter eines besonderen Spektakels. Hinter den Casino-Spieltischen in diesem Bereich räkelns sich leicht geschürzte Damen nach heißer Musik in einer Art Käfig an langen Stangen. Klar, dass dann bei den Spieler die Jetons lockerer sitzen, wo doch zusätzlich die Spielleiter an den Tischen dann alles Damen sind, die ebenso in reizender Uniform ihren Dienst versehen.

Ich war jetzt zwei mal dort (Nov. 12 und April 13), habe mich wohl gefühlt und kann die Bar empfehlen.","7YBLX19t_P_CfPzM3JbolA",4,"2013-06-14",3,"review",5

They are all made with fresh pureed fruit, and come with a straw for extra sipping fun; I enjoyed the grapefruit-based one in particular.  Of course, they also have a full bar.

* Great ambiance.  The bar is located within Caesar's Palace, elevated a bit from the gaming floor and delineated by a half-wall that allows you to watch the gamblers and passerby.  The decor is defined by the giant cylindrical fish tank in the center of the bar, which lends a peaceful air to the place despite the business of the surrounds.  The chairs are large and comfy, and conversation is possible despite a medium level of background noise.

 I searched on YELP and found Primrose. We did the same trial day at Primrose. My son went in the classroom and we stayed in the Lobby and popped into the window randomly every 15-30 mins to see how he was doing and within 30 mins I could already tell his experience was going to be so much better at Primrose. Your ratio of 5 or 6 to 1 is just right but most of the time the ratio I've seen is 3 or 4 to 1 because once there were 7 kids, there were 2 teachers in the room. The teachers in the toddler rooms are SO WONDERFUL! Not only do they provide the early education the toddlers need but they also provide the right amount of affection to each child to keep them comfortable in their group environment.  I also tend to watch the other kids whenever I am in the room because I know I can see a LOT from the other kid's behaviors that will give me some information on how the teachers are with them. I see the other kids always running  to their teachers to show off the toys they've found or just running up to them to hug their legs. This tells me the kids feel comfortable and find safety and security with their teachers. They run to their teachers to show off their toys because their teachers give them a positive reaction that the kids enjoy receiving. During my son's first week I left my work at random times during the day to pick him up at different times just to see how he was doing on different days and every time I arrived, I always found a teacher either holding him or my son enjoying an activity with the other toddlers like story time, painting or music/dancing time. I LOVE YOUR SCHOOL AND YOUR TEACHERS. Of course I can only mainly speak for the toddler teachers because they are the ones I deal with but on many occasions when teachers from other rooms have seen me in the hallway, they have ALWAYS stopped to ask me if there was anything they could do for me. They even peek into the room and watch my son for me and give me real-time feedback on how my son is doing as I hide away from the door so he doesn't see me. THANK YOU FOR FOSTERING SUCH A WARM AND LOVING ENVIRONMENT! This means the WORLD to all the parents of the Primrose students.

I have to also mention the ladies in the front who comforted ME during the first 2 weeks and encouraged me to call as many times as I wanted to check in on my son (and believe me, DID I Call A LOT LOL!) Every time I call, they are so nice and are so happy to give me feedback.

Of course, I must also mention your facility. It's so clean! The toys are always clean and bright.  Your daily menu is superb! Sometimes I tell my husband my son should go on his off day because the food being served that day looks so good. :) I love the Primrose App that I am able to download to see the weekly menu, events, and announcements.

The last thing I am going to mention is just due to, well...my husband and I being picky people and that is how we appreciate that everyone in your staff always has a presentable appearance! We totally noticed how they have variations of their Primrose Shirts to wear everyday and they manage to always look neat which can be difficult since the kids are probably flailing paint, water and food at them throughout the day :)

I know we are new and have only been there for 3 weeks but I have also stopped to get feedback from other parents whose children have been with your school for a while and their reviews on your facility and staff are just how I described them above.   I know my son is in the right place. We will be trying for a second child next year and we are looking forward to our experience with your infant care.

Please thank your staff for me and again, thank YOU! I am not listing names only because I don't want to accidentally leave anyone out :)","04u9KK6f-FUnU69mioNP2g",5,"2014-06-19",0,"review",0

My wife and I looked at every daycare/preschool in the Avondale/Tolleson/Goodyear/Buckeye/Litchfield Park area when we moved here.  Primrose School stood out as the best option by far.

We are fans of Piaget-based learning and development programs.  The time and stage of development is important, so it's valuable if you can find a school that fulfills the character, educational, social, and physical needs of your kid.  The Velardi family and the staff they have put together teach to those goals and earnestly care for our daughter and her friends.  

Over the past 18 months, we have seen very little turnover and both teachers and school staff communicate exceptionally well with parent.  Special events like the holiday show and parents night out are a nice touch.  And we are very pleased with how our little girl is developing.  We've made some long-term friends.

Couldn't recommend a preschool any more than I do Primrose at Palm Valley.","04u9KK6f-FUnU69mioNP2g",5,"2013-02-14",3,"review",0

"2675",1,"3OTvjJqt27XgPjBCBNr6Zg","e0UhaG6yk6P6LLbPvRWHKg","Primrose Palm Valley ""promises"" to provide a safe and nurturing learning environment where children can thrive.  The reality is that this environment is unstructured, unstable, inconsistent, lacks communication, and the business owner/franchisee (Karen Verlardi) will spin the truth to get your business.  You will be told that this place is the best daycare in the West Valley.  In reality, this is your typical daycare mill (with a high price tag) that focuses more on quantity and less on quality. For that reason, I would like to share my experience: 

My toddler started here in August 2013 and after two days here he started telling me ""No Primrose Daddy"" every morning while in the Primrose parking lot.  After two weeks, it got worse, my wife scheduled an appointment and approached the franchisee with this information.  My wife was assured that it was my negative energy and lack of a morning routine that was affecting my son at drop off [really?].  Giving Primrose the benefit of the doubt, I started to consciously be extremely positive in the mornings with a consistent routine (as always).

As parents, we think it is very important for children to have consistency in the daycare experience.  We understand that unanticipated events happen but we expect that any changes with our child's primary care team be communicated as soon as possible through telephone or e-mail.  Timely communications about our child's primary care team's attendance (absence, planned vacation, or permanent rotation) was non-existent.    

To make a long story short, drop-offs and daycare staff consistencies were not the only struggles we encountered at Primrose Palm Valley.  We experienced high turnover in the daycare staff; daily reports were not consistently filled out; dirty/muddy clothes and soiled diapers upon pickup; we reported bulling several times with no resolution; my son came home with a shirt that was cut open in several spots by scissors.  Each incident was brought up to the administration staff, some issues were never solved, and the bullying never stopped.  My son came home several times telling us that a specific kid hit or pushed him.  We were assured by the administration that my son was not being bullied and that the bully he identified, was not in attendance on the days he mentioned he was being hit/pushed [yeah right, we have pictures to prove otherwise].

The last straw was in October 2013, when changes were made to the staff, which encompassed reassignment of my son's primary teacher to a new classroom to cover a staff member that quit the previous Friday - that's their official story.  Upon questioning  administration at the front desk, I was told that my son's primary teacher was reassigned due to her personal reasons which required her to shift her schedule to come in later in the day - get your story straight!  Whichever the truth, it is not acceptable to learn about a permanent change in the primary daycare staff at drop-off time.  Because we didn't have a daycare contingency plan for an event like that, we were forced to leave our child there that day and hope for the best. Upon pickup that day, my wife observed boogers on our child's face and a muddy shirt. 

Primrose Palm Valley does not meet their own expectations, which is why they have a rotating door of clients and caregivers.  When I told Karen Verlardi my child will no longer be attending Primrose and asked that the two week notice requirement be waived, she met me with words of contempt, rudeness, and complete disrespect.  

Bottom line: I was told multiple lies, the environment is inconsistent, they do not practice what they preach, and I am happy that my child is no longer in their care.","04u9KK6f-FUnU69mioNP2g",1,"2014-01-20",6,"review",0

Oddly enough, we heard about Primrose from a resident of a nearby neighborhood, definite random luck!  When that mom mentioned it to my mom, she called immediately.  My mom toured Primrose on our behalf, you know Grandmas can be more critical than parents and she is!  So when she gave it a thumbs up, I knew we would be fine.  Then I toured Primrose on my next Phoenix visit and found it well rounded, structured but with a lot of fun....perfect for kids, right!?

Here we are going on almost 4 years and our daughter loves going to school.  The team at Primrose has evolved with us and our daughter.  They have a difficult mission to fulfill and they do it seamlessly and with a smile on their face.  Primrose is not a fit for every family of course, but I think everyone should at the least, check it out and decide.

We have made great friends through the Primrose school!  Families are involved and I think the teachers go above and beyond .... because they love their kids!

Had it not been for the company I was with, I would have been extremely disappointed.  Every experience is what you make it, and we made it fun, although yes they ran out of crawfish, yes the lines were to Louisiana, and yes there were only a few food vendors.  There was not a cap on pounds of crawfish you could buy.  The last 9lbs of crawfish were sold to one person.  

My family arrived a later in the evening and two lines they hopped in ran out of food.  They did eat the catfish, which was so good.  I had roasted corn which was smothered in butter and I covered with parmesan and Cajun flavoring they had there.  Yummy! Later in the evening, one of the vendors had crawfish, which I tried.  The taste was not something I would jump up and down for, I've had better.  My friend and I tried the pineapple yogurt, which was refreshing.  I didn't know the difference when reading the sign of the breakdown of flavors, so I ordered the cheapest one, which was just pineapple frozen yogurt, with out the juice or fresh pineapple.  

As far as experience goes, I was just chatting with people in line as we were waiting.  Music was going and my friend was dancing with my niece which was so cute.  Although the food was a bit of a bust, the crowd that I was around was just there for a good time and that's what they had.  This could have been a really good event, but this is their first one.

Hey, that's fine with me, the less crowd, the better the finds. Anyways, I really wanted to come to get some used records and books.

The place is really huge, I could have spent all day in here! Unfortunately, I only had about two hours. As soon as I walked in, I went through the Trader Marc's Antiques doorway to the right. They had some really pretty items and antiques, I was tempted to buy everything. If you go all the way to the back section of their store, that's where you hit the jackpot with their records.

Now, let me tell you something about their records. They have an AWESOME selection, defintely not like the crappy stuff you find in thrift stores or consignment shops. Everything is organized in alphabetical order and of section of Rock, Folk, Jazz, etc. The Rock section is definitely the biggest, and it consists of all the records from like the 50's to the 90's or so. The only downfall is that there were really no current records, but I guess that's expected. Most of the records range from $2-$8, but the rarer ones can go up to $30. It's kinda pricey as far as records go, but the selection is so good and you're still getting a good bargain.

You've got everything from The Doors to The Rolling Stones to Queen to Madonna and so on. Just before I could get to the crate, this guy swiped up a Jimi Hendrix record for 20 bucks. Not sure which one it was, but bummer for me :( It's all good, cause I walked away with Tommy by The Who for $8, and The Beatles Greatest Hits '62-'66 for $18. 

After that, I check out the used books at the front of the market right when you enter. There were a ton, but I couldn't find any classics or really old books. I'm always on the lookout for first edition copies, but these people knew what they were doing and they wouldn't put out any ""by accident"". 

By the time I had finished with this, the vendors were already starting to close, at 4:30! Weren't we supposed to have another 30 min? Oh well. From what I could see that hadn't closed yet, there were some jewelry shops, purse vendors, clothing stalls, and even a makeup stand that was selling OPI and MAC makeup. Beware, although it looked legit, I doubt it really was. There were a few other vendors that were selling some records, but none of them were really worth looking at. 

Altogether, Trader Marc's was a cool experience. I'd definitely go back and see what I could find. It's worth going to visit and walking around, even if you don't wanna buy anything :)","1og7Z51AlgqTHI9DsHQiVA",4,"2011-01-08",1,"review",0

The gentleman working the front counter was helpful and straightforward, the woman who did my exam however, didn't seem too happy to help.

The whole exam felt rushed, and as if I shouldn't have been there at all!

I've been served by the same hairdresser both my trips, and she remembered me the second go round, which makes for a pleasant welcome. Size-wise, It's a small joint, but more than enough room for the ladies to perform their miracles, and it feels reasonably homey inside.

What seals the deal for me is the prices are totally reasonable--I've seen some places that make my eyes practically roll back in my head around town, and I've never been one to willingly shell out a week's paycheck for my hair. But Angel has fair prices to match the excellent service. My first go featured a simple cut, the second, a full coloring, and I'd give five stars to each venture. This is definitely my go-to salon!

Like most ladies, I am slightly obsessed with having good hair. Now what good hair is, will be a subjective point of view, but for me it is manageable and generally shiny and healthy looking as a result of a great cut. 

I first reviewed Angel Hairdressing about 3 months ago on my first visit. It's a local salon and after standing by it waiting for the bus for 2 years, I decided to give it a go when my budget couldn't stretch to a posh town salon do.

So now, it is review No.200 and it had to be a 5 * review. 

Even though I my last hair cut was 3 months ago - I hadn't actually reached hair crisis point. My style had held perfectly even when growing and it was only as it really started to thicken up again (and growing very quickly) that I decided to cut it back again. It is probably the first hair cut that I've had where I've left a salon, the do has lasted a good few days before I had to wash and dry myself and it has been something I have been able to recreate myself, abet in Claire form, and not hairdresser form. 

Again - same fab cut. It is a small salon with one sink and 4 chairs. There are two stylists  - Lisa who I think is the owner and Kerry who cuts my hair and who I think is fab. Same wet and dry cut as before - still in about 50 minutes even though my shape from last time had still held well, so again, great attention to detail to ensure my hair is perfect. Fab friendly and cheery service and great prices - still £28 for a cut and blow dry and I think it is under £15 for a wash and blow dry.

We started off by having the bruschetta. Their bruschetta is piled high on each piece of bread they give you. You can really taste the fresh ingredients, but for some reason it all seems to fail to come together in the end. There is something missing. This ended up being a theme of our meals there. My girlfriend had a pizza with pesto and grilled chicken pieces. The chicken could have been spread out a little more throughout the pizza, but this could be the way they do it in Italy so I can't judge. This dish also seem to struggle to bring everything together.bThe dish I had was a creamy pasta with goat cheese and walnuts. I actually really enjoyed this dish but somehow think it needed just a little more kick.

Being on the tourist trap of a street that is crescent, I wasn't expecting cheap prices. Many of their dishes are more on the expensive side but considering some of the ingredients and the nice location it is pretty justifiable.

Our waitress smiled and was very nice and didn't bother us too much which I liked. We could have received more water even though we had order drinks though. Other than this very good service.

In the end I prob wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if I was with friends and wanted to relax with a drink I would definetly hit this place up.","83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw",3,"2014-07-05",0,"review",0

The food was mediocre at best, the ""rolls"" were more like hot dog buns, the caprese salad boasted unripe tomatoes, no balsamic vinegar and some sort of pre-packaged pesto sauce that looked like baby diarrhea...

What I liked: Restaurant is pretty roomy. The resto has an upper floor for bigger parties. The view gives on to Crescent and de Maisoneuve. The portions were reasonable. The price was too. I had the chicken al palio which was decent. I suggest ordering pasta, because theres a large selection and it comes with a decent amount of protein or vegetables. The crowd seems reletively young (early and late 20s), especially when I was there. The drinks are averagely sized, I didnt check the price though. 

What I didn't like: My friend who was the birthday girl had made a reservation for the correct amount of people, but when she arrived places were missing. We were stuck reorganizing the seating our selves. I feel they really work hard to give a true italian feel by allowing a 45 minute delay between serving everyone else and then serving me. The music wasn't appropriate at all, a mix of rap with some asian sounding stuff. Given that it was the coldest day of the year, most of us froze upstairs waiting to get our plates and then waiting to pay. 

Conclusion: not my favorite resto. I wouldnt call it ""authentic"" food, although the disorganized managament seems authentically italian. You'll probably not see me back here. The only thing that could bring me back is the location. But not the food.","83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw",3,"2014-01-05",1,"review",1

they have an outdoor seating area upstairs with a long canopy over it - this was great, because we got the cool fresh air and none of the rain. and it's actually fairly spacious, wrapping around the entire place (it's on the corner). 

I ordered some of the house white wine. it was about average, though it also was fairly cheap, so I'm not complaining too much. service was pretty fast too.

the fact that it is so roomy here might have made it seem less busy than it was. there were plenty of patrons up near us, but there were two HUGE rooms inside (on the second floor alone) that were empty. what gives? maybe they focus more on large-scale events.

seems like an alright place to relax for a drink or two, but not much more. I like low-key, but it was a bit too low-key for me.","83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw",2,"2012-08-21",6,"review",3

For the entree, I ordered a pizza. Oh man. All of the ingredients came straight from a can and were clumped in weird bunches across the surface of the pie. The olives were barely drained and the crust was overly doughy.

The waitress seemed to mean well but she didn't seem to understand how bad the food was there. And so she seemed annoyed at our lack of enthusiasm for the place. The management is responsible for the poor quality of this place, not the poor waitress who served us.

I'm not expecting a lot when it's a situation like this, but this restaurant was not able to live up to my already lowered expectation. 

Food:
The server brought us two baskets of complimentary bread with a dish of olive oil and vinegar . The bread looks decent, they look like some homemade croissants. But, the texture was awful!  None of us can take a second bite of it, it's so dry! It taste like it's either a few days old or it has been microwaved multiple times! Also, the olive oil to share? what is this? Are they expecting everyone to dip in that plate? It's so gross....and inconvenient. Its okay to share butter or other spread, but I've never shared olive oil before.
We ordered an Italian sausage pizza as appetizers to share, it was average, the crust was too thick...nothing special.
Main course, I ordered a veggie primervera, which is just vegetarian pasta with tomato sauce.  It did not satisfy me either, overall very blend and in terms of vegetables, I was expecting some portebello mushroom, big slice of eggplants and cucumber, cherry tomato.... but instead, it's all thinly sliced, you almost can't see them in your pasta, and just regular mushroom that were shrunk after cooking. The tomato sauce was also too glue-y.....
Dessert - I shared a Tiramisu with a friend, it's the type that comes in a cup with lady fingers at the bottom of the cup. This was like one of the worst tiramisu you can get at a restaurant. It tastes like store bought, and made one week ago. The cheese on the top are already becoming chewy and jello like! We only had half

The food are so terrible, when the server came and ask how were the  food, I actually said it tastes bad (because he saw our unfinished tiramisu) and I think he was offended.

Service:
He forgot to bring the spoon for people who ordered pasta. SO this is what happened, I asked for a spoon as soon as he puts down my plate of pasta, and it took him like 5mins to come back because he went off and took care of other tables and he forgot... when he came back, he only brought 1 spoon for me, not for my other friends who were also having pasta. (well, you'd expect him to bring enough for everyone who's having pasta, that's a standard utensils to eat pasta , especially it's an Italian restaurant, how do you not know that) ...Later, my friends that are sitting at the other end of the table had to ask him again for spoon...

I am super skeptical when trying new programs so I wanted to check them out thoroughly. I primarily partake in the Jeet Kune Do training as I have always wanted to learn this system of fighting. So I checked the instructor's website http://phoenixjkd.com/ and read it thoroughly. 

The instructor, Sharam, lists his lineage (he is a third generation instructor) there so I actually called his instructor to confirm. Everything checked out. Then I decided to simply take advantage of the trial period. I asked Sharam a slew of very direct questions to which all of his answers met or exceeded my expectations. His teaching methods during that trial, and ever since, have shown him to be an excellent teacher. Everything is broken down to a simple teaching so the newest person in the room can grasp the information. 

Everything we have learned in just one short month has blown away everything I have ever learned. I used to hold my own sparring with black belts and I learned combat fighting serving 8 years in the Marine Corps yet I feel like I did not know how to REALLY fight. Everything Sharam teaches is easily learned and highly effective for use in a full on fight. This is not your local dojo. 

In short:

- The JKD class is the real deal
- The gym owner is pretty cool and straightforward
- The rates are awesome
- The schedule fits nicely with my retail craziness
- The gym is on the small side but adequately equipped and growing
- I love this class, if you ever wanted to learn JKD this is the one for you!","-zsuqmH7ixFx0y3xPIQH_w",5,"2014-08-26",0,"review",0

I was having problems sourcing dowels for a cake so thought I would Pop in whilst I  was in the area.  The customer service was pants! I had a good look and could pretty much see everything but dowels.  I asked the woman behind the counter if they had any or was it a case I couldn't see for looking and she very snappily said they will be over there if we have any and flipped her hand in the direction of the dowels, I really should have left then But I REALLY needed those dowlels as my delivery hadn't arrived in time.

I had a look and she came over and pointed and said in a very brusque manner well they should be there! I really felt like it was my fault thee were no dowels.  Because of my order not arriving I did need to pick some stuff up but only did so as I was in a fix otherwise I would have left.  I asked for 21's on a stick as they seemed to be every number there but 21 and she snapped again.. We don't have any! Seriously love, it's not my fault but yet you make me feel like it is!

As we were paying, another lady came out and she was much more friendly, which is why I gave an extra star.  She explained that the dowels had been ordered but as one thing was out of stock on the order the whole order had been put on hold... There see that wasn't too hard, a friendly member of staff with an explanation... That's all the situation needed, unfortunately she was too late to make my experience a good one because of the awful attitude of her colleague.

I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like "" missing manual or dead battery"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. 
I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. 
I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. 
I get ""as is"" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.
Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. 
Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.

A few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service. Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.

I since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!

I told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.

This brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.

I prefer this store to Carlton St. The layout is a little nicer and the bins are smaller with a place for the spoon.

I was hesitant to check it out for the first thing you think of when you hear this is ....bad area or crappy landlord.  
  I checked out Silver Shadows Apartments and I am proud to say that I am glad I took a chance on them!  The two ladies that takes care of the complex is nothing but INCREDIBLE!!!!

I remember going in there and practically decorating everything in my first apartment from the old store. They had it all. Great location, great furniture, great big gold-framed Rococo mirrors, giant plants, floral papasan chairs at a fraction of what you  would pay at Pier 1.Then you had all the knick knacks and odds-and ends to look at.

Now it's re-located to the Atwater market area, firmly ensconced among the gentrified factories-turned-condos along the Lachine canal. Now it's on one floor instead of two (Ok, 1 and 1/2 if you include the ramp in the back). Now the plants are majorly overpriced and so are the kitchen goods and gadgets, probably in line with keeping up with their new yuppie clientele. Now the people who work the cash are pretty rude and abrupt when long ago they were friendly enough to even deliver bigger purchases. You know a situation is bad when you've just bought a whole slew of plant potters and you need to ask for a bag and get a scowl in return.

While it's true their kitchen selection has some neat, one-of-a-kind stuff, it's not fun coming here anymore. It feels more like a chore.

Synopsis: service excellent, food outstanding, cocktails amazing.

We dined a scaramouche last week and most of us hated (and I don't use that word often) the cocktails. Here we found each one unique, beautifully presented and most important tasty.

The oysters were all delicious and fresh even though I don't understand serving a hot sauce with something so flavourful.

Duck confit- score. I think there was deep fried apple in there.  Steak - beautiful cut and perfectly cooked but I have to admit I dont like my steak covered in sauce but I think that was my mistake. The fennel salad had too much of a similar creamy texture. Fried oysters were lost. Daughter had trout and which was excellent and beautifully paired with watermelon radish.

Perfect white ganache to sip on.

We came from Parts & Labour next door, where the service was terrible but at least they had Summerlicious to use as a poor excuse. Can't say the same for Geraldine, where we were greeted by a permanent air of I-hate-our-customers.

As our server brought the first drink (and first bill) to our table, she informed us that it was ""cash and carry"" because it was ""late"". We were like, ""Huh?"" It wasn't even busy and the bar wasn't closing. She said we'd have to pay for each drink as we went. I've never been to a sit-down place with $18+tax drinks that had a bill accompany every glass, but it's certainly a good way to leave a sour taste in people's mouths before they've even tasted the Sazerac.

We'd barely taken our first sips when the server came back, pointedly* tapped on the cheque she'd just brought my friend and said something like, ""Your bill's right here."" Yeah, we know! You told us five seconds ago. Holy tacky.

Before we left, another friend with more cojones than yours truly spoke to our server to politely question the automatic 20% gratuity** based on the level (read: low) of service she received. Even after some back and forth, in an amazing demonstration of the very lack of customer service skills being called out, the server refused to reissue the bill. Seriously? Is the auto-tip on groups here a free pass to be awful? Another girl accidentally double-tipped because of this, too.

I'm not sure what the folks at Geraldine found to dislike about making quick money on a chilled-out group downing pricy drinks for maybe an hour. The styling is fancy but the vibe was so not. Maybe it was just this one server, but I won't be back to find out. Cheers!

*Speaking of ""pointedly"", the bartender scooped up a loose flower petal on the side of my glass with his finger and plopped it right back in, giving my cocktail what NSYNC would refer to as a ""digital digital getdown"". I'm no flower myself, so I didn't mind, but a germaphobe might shudder.

Food service took some time and while we initially ordered oysters it took easily 30 minutes to get them out. We had a variety of sides but had to ask for more and at $6 for a plate of olives it's a bit pricey. The Cauliflower was pretty good but very salty, the shrimp and grits were excellent. In terms of mains I had the quail which was served on a piece of toast with a corn type salad, it was not hearty at all and very boney, a little pricey for the amount of food served up. My wife had a steak as did a few others at the table, no one was really raving about it, I tried it and felt it was very buttery. The others had the seafood broth or whatever fancy french word they used, I tried it and it was very good, that was the winner at the table. Dessert unfortunately there was only one choice and no one went for it, i thought that was a bit sad to not offer more towards the end. Overall our bill came to just under 600 with tip, I feel that when there is a big party a restaurant should not bring down their service, nobody came to ask us how are food was, no one asked us if they can get us anything else, our wine glasses were touched up on once and there was no explanation of any food that was coming out of the kitchen except for the oysters. I thought that area was lacking. Nice atmosphere and we are lucky we had good company, but overall this place is average as many places in Toronto and will have to get a little better in certain areas.  I would suggest maybe adding a few more items to the menu under mains and dessert.","3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA",3,"2014-10-24",0,"review",0

We heard that our good friend Alex (former chef of Farmhouse) was back in town and had recently taken the reigns of this Parkdale restaurant.. not to mention that Geraldine was on our ""places to go"" list for quite some time anyway... So it seemed like the perfect time to go. 

As soon as we walked in, we fell into a time-warp and instantly we were transported to the 1920s during prohibition. The vibe was cool and calm, the staff was warm and friendly. 

First, the drinks.... Marie had warned me about the prices of the drinks and I couldn't understand why they charged so much for cocktails.  Needless to say, I ate my words in the form of a beverage.  Easily the best cocktails in the city, no contest. 

Michael is a wizard behind the bar, constructing his elixirs right in the open for on-lookers to see.  I was thrilled to see REAL Absinthe on the cocktail menu, but I was even more excited when I saw how he prepared it and presented it.  I am not going to spoil it for you, you just have to see for yourself... Amazing. 

Our server Brendan offered up some oysters from East Coast to West Coast.  This guy knew his shit and you could tell he took pride in his work.  He took care of us for the evening, we never felt rushed and it was completely relaxing.... or perhaps that was the Absinthe talking?

For me, Chef Molitz' challenge was going to be finding his stride within the French realm of cooking and technique.  This is a stark contrast to the rustic Modern-Canadian style that we are all use to from Alex.  So this dinner was going to be interesting, at least from the point of view of a French food geek like myself. 

There is a reason why Alex is revered as one of Toronto's best; his ability to serve up consistent, rich flavours that are on point and familiar to the senses.  The Duck Croquette reminded me of childhood dinners of mash potatoes and turkey at Thanksgiving.  And the Duck Confit was crispy and salty just as it should be, served with bean cassoulet that was smokey and creamy.   Delicious. 

If I had to order one thing on the menu, (aside from the Absinthe of course) it would be the Vietnamese Coffee and Chocolate Chip cookies.  It simply hits all the right areas.

The beers are pretty much all American domestics (it's a dive bar, come on) but I was really stoked that they had Old Grand Dad 100 on the bar- it's one of my favorite low-price bourbons, and the liquor selection is pretty decent. Plus the bartender was friendly and the specials were pretty good. 

Brass Rail isn't as nice as Bentley's, but it's a great little stop on impromptu pub crawls, and I'd like to go back.","6UiBaTM6_ENF_L53C0CHTw",3,"2014-02-08",1,"review",0

On a Friday night, the place was near deserted after about 10:30pm, with a regular or two, a couple of drunks and a group of quiet students. Seating is in cramped booths unsuitable for people taller than 6', or at the bar. The interior is hideous: bugly, dated paneling, linoleum and illumination by neon promo signs. My kind of place.

They have 2 beers on tap as I recall, PBR and High Life. The special that night was Hamm's cans, which were had for (surprisingly, to me) more than a dollar each. The good news is that either Hamm's is a lot better than I remember, or I was drunker than I thought. I had been drinking 'good' beer at other downtown establishments known for the same, but the Hamm's were somehow better. Thinking about how well those Hamm's hit the spot makes me want one right now.

The Brass Rail has an internet juke box to kill the otherwise oppressive silence, and is a total ripoff if you put less than $5 in, but has an impressive selection. They have a soft-tip dartboard, a couple of tvs and a broken pinball machine. They also have frozen pizza that they can make for you for less than $5, but it is pretty crappy pizza. Huber's' pizza is way better. Ours got burnt black in places and was too salty but  was still promptly devoured. For two days I wondered how I burned my mouth.

Service is great, and friendly. The bartender has an excellent rapport with her patrons, a quick wit and a kindness that comes across right away. I can definitely see this as a place to go back to.","6UiBaTM6_ENF_L53C0CHTw",4,"2010-09-28",4,"review",1

AND I LOVE THAT.  The Rail....best dang place.  The older I get, the less I want to deal with people. I am officially Red from That 70s Show. And this place allows me to be just that....non social, possibly partially angry, and drunk. On cheap beer. Who doesn't love cheap beer?  Don't get a draft....who knows how long those kegs have been sitting there. But then again, who gets draft when you can get a Hamms for $2.25 any day of the week? I mean....common sense, right?  

Anyway, very few beer selections but who cares. You don't go to the Rail to be super snazzy. It's literally the epitome of the dive bar. So take it as it is and stop complaining. Excellent jukeox (but people...stop effing hitting ""play next"" or using your stupid phone app). Jukebox etiquette people. Jukebox etiquette. Never expect to hear all the same music every time you come in either, nor really anything that is newer typically.  Which is awesome....keep your new age music out (juuuust kidding....sort of). You've got your regulars and they are all amazing. The bartenders are also fabulous - but as I said about the Rail...take them as they are. Two of em are just a couple of no BS folks who aren't gonna deal with your uppity attitudes and the other is such a down to earth guy who wants to make sure everyone has a drink and enjoy whatever random songs come across the jukebox.

Nothing super special about this place, which actually makes it incredibly special in its own right.  If you're looking for a crowd or somewhere that offers an copious selection of beer and liquors, go elsewhere. If you're looking to just sit back and relax and maybe get to know some of the regulars, who are always happy to talk about music and maybe some other stuff mixed in there, this is your spot.","6UiBaTM6_ENF_L53C0CHTw",5,"2016-07-15",1,"review",0

On my first visit, I was mid-process of checking out and decided to pay with cash.  My  first $20 goes in no problem...the second one got stuck in the shoot and ended up ripping so the feeder would no longer take it.  I politely waved over the cashier and asked if she could help with the issue.  

She walked away with my wounded bill, for what I assumed was to get a crisp $20...No.  She tapes the bill together on both sides. 

As she hands it back to me she hovers over me and watches me attempt once to have issues inserting it into the bill feeder.  Which was unsuccessful.

She then reaches over my shoulder and starts rubbing the paper of the bill between her fingers and CLEARLY and DIRECTLY  asks me ""Where did you get this?  This doesn't' feel like REAL money.""  

(AFTER she spent time with it TAPING it back together)

Now, I was cashier in college, so I know how to identify a counterfeit.  So I raise the bill to the light and see there is a money strip within it, and I took the time to show her.  She simply scoffed at me, kept insisting the weight of the paper wasn't right to be REAL money, and then goes to the monitor and forces it back to pay with a card and then walks away.  

So I force the screen back to paying with cash and get the bill in the feeder on my second try.  I take my receipt and start to walk out...and she stops me and asks me ""Did you pay for that, how did you get it to work?"" Forcing me to open my hands to PROVE my receipt.

Also tasted the bacon and cheese quiche, not microwaveable but really exceptional.  My good man dallas g. bought two types of hummus, both largely satisfactory and more!  (spicy jalapeno hummus and roasted red pepper hummus...)

Offered ZERO advice or guidance on tax credits, deductions, the process of paying the IRS or receiving a refund.  Dug?  Why am I paying you then?  I know little about taxes, so it felt like the blind leading the blind.  Dont pay this company hundreds of dollars to file your taxes if you expect any guidance.

As a new business owner with little to no tax knowledge, I trusted the practice to guide me.  Let's face it, from the outside, this firm is very regal and appears to be the end all be all for accounting firms.  The first year the firm did our taxes, it was easy and painless.  The moment I started asking for help or asking questions I would receive, that will cost you $120+ per hour, we don't give info over the phone and I'd get referred to some website to search for an answer.  After paying hundreds of dollars for completed returns, an SCorp filing and a DBA filing and not knowing how to move forward, I called.  Once again, I was told it was a fee to talk to them.  The receptionist Jeanie, along with both Fish brothers, speak down to their customers-they have little to no respect and are completely unwilling to help-even after spending HUNDREDS of dollars for their services.  It's as if they expect you to know how to do their job and get annoyed and frustrated when you don't know tax.  I've NEVER received such horrific service from what appeared to be a reputable company.  I'm at year end, didn't pull a salary, never was explained what needed to happen and I'm needing to have a salary shown NOW.  Well, isn't that great...there goes my income for the rest of the year because the estimates they provided were far from accurate.

For a long time I thought that the Southeast was falling behind to Summerlin, but not any more. The growth of unique, affordable, and fun eateries has made it so that I rarely venture up north anymore. 

SRJ offers many delectable treats for a reasonable price. Before committing to anything, they offer tastings of the day. The macadamia white fudge is magnificent. They were not pieces of the nut, but actual whole ones mixed into the confection. Since I had eaten my amount of sweets for the day, I had picked up a piece of pumpkin cake ($2.25) and a package of peanut butter cookies ($3) for my parents. I took a bite of the cake while sitting with my mom and it was moist, had the signature taste of fall, and not sickeningly sweet. The cookies were on sale since they were not made that day. A pack of four large cookies were only $3. I felt them and they were still soft. 

They were doing a test run on seasoned roast nuts. The curry one was nice, but needed more spice. The lady behind the counter was very receptive about suggestions.

We turned in to the drive through and like a beacon in the night I saw the back door of Sweet Ruby Janes touting ""cake-pops"". I'd been intrigued before and this was my chance. 

To my surprise they were giving away free anniversary cake pops, which was fab-u-lous. So Gibson chose a red velvet cake pop and I went to the tea wall. What a pleasant surprise, I picked out a Sunny Passion tea, got a chocolate nut bar for Patrick and let Gibson pick out a couple more pieces; a raspberry butterfly sucker and a white chocolate covered Oreo.   Oh, and thanks to the kind saleswoman I got a cake pop too!

I didn't even make it to the freezer for the icy treats, which is my soft spot.  I'll be back to check it out.  And the decor . . . is adorable. Just the shop you want to pick out delicious candies and teas from. 

By the way, everything was delicious.  Choco covered Oreo was unbelievable, it had such a nice thick coating of white chocolate.  The fact that I was tardy was completely forgotten!","0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw",5,"2012-09-07",0,"review",0

I am a bit of a chocolate snob, so the first thing I noticed was the white chocolate has a bit of yellow to it- this is good people!  White chocolate that is too white looks that way because more fat and sugar has been added to stretch it, none of those cheap tricks here.  I also like that it's a small family business (owners are sisters, Ruby Jane was their grandmother), which I always feel good supporting.  Alright, enough rambling, onto the chocolate!

What I had:
White chocolate bark with caramel and toasted coconut.  My favorite item :) and one of the cheaper ones since it didn't have heavy stuff like caramel and peanut butter (most items are priced by weight).

Macadamia and cashew caramel nut clusters with dark chocolate?  Well OK, if you twist my arm!  SO yummy, and used whole nuts.

White chocolate covered almonds.  Simple and tasty, would get these again.

Dark chocolate peanut butter cup, probably my least favorite thing.  It was still good, but not out of this world.

Dark chocolate covered caramel.  Excellent caramel, but I like mine topped with a nice sea salt for the sweet/salty flavor combo, and their version didn't have that touch.","0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw",5,"2012-02-28",1,"review",0

It has a small storefront, which is fine for a candy store. Let me say, that I was expecting it to be more of a candy store, it really seemed to have more Chocolatey treats. No complaints from the kids about that though. We were greeted by friendly counter staff, offered several samplings for free, and finally my kids decided on a marshmallow, chocolate covered treat on a stick. They were about $2 each, tasted fine and the kids liked them. Not sure if it was the right selection for $2 a piece though. 

They have a birthday club, where you sign up and get free stuff on your birthday. I need to go back to sign up.

I think I have sampled all of the cookies and they are all good, but the best are the oatmeal (it doesn't even taste like oatmeal! more like a light sugar cookie with an oat-y texture) and the toffee. So good. They are big, thin cookies, so not too doughy, but they are still soft. I also had the chocolate-dipped pretzels (good) and several of the dipped marshmallows (milk chocolate, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee...delicious!). I see reviews for chocolate-covered grahams, so I will definitely be trying those next.
The little store is super cute, with outdoor seating (kinda sucks if the weather is hot, cold, or windy) and the owner was very friendly.

At a Yelp event they attended (Rock N Roll KissMas) I met the owners when they had cake pops and learned all the treats made in their shop are recipes handed down by the owners grandma.

My (and Mr. B's) favorite confections gotta be their butter toffees. Especially the toffee chip cookies. Their toffee brittle is smooth,shiny and tastes so buttery. You dont have to bite too hard to break off a piece. 
 
You will also find oreo, pretzels and TWINKIES dipped in CHOCOLATE!. I like that they are individually wrapped with cute packaging and make fun little surprise gifts for those ""just cause"" occasions.

First of all their sign is so eye catching from the road and the size of the sign makes it easy to spot. Right when you walk in you are instantly drawn to the many varities of chocolate everythings....
The Smores with caramel is freakin awsome as well as those Oatmeal Crispies. I was hestitant to eat an Oatmeal Crispie as I only enjoy chewy cookies and it says it's crisp. The lady behind the counter told me that's it's crisp around the edges but chewy inside and boy was she right. You can taste all the butter- trust me this cookie is a winner. Another winner for me was the Chocolate Crinkle cookie - tastes just like a dark chocolate brownie.
There were lots of festive Halloween goodies to be had. I bought a rice krispie dipped in chocolate on a stick and a large marshmallow dipped in white and dark chocolate on a stick with eyes for my kid. She equally loved both of them.
My sister loved her turtle....
A miss for me was what seemed like a saltine cracker dipped in chocolate. I bought it because it said that is was a salty/sweet treat and I like salty/sweet but this didn't work for me. However, someone else may really like this- there's always something for someone right?....
If you sign up to be part of their club every month you get to have a good sized sample of their new item. For October it was Pecan Brittle and the Lady said for December it very well might be Peppermint Bark - so sign up- - it's free!!!!

Two bookmarked places in one night!  Alas, it was 6:20pm and before we could get inside, one of the ladies was already locking the door--closing time was 6:00pm!  As we stood peeking through the windows at the goodies inside, the kind lady had pity on us and unlocked the door-- talk about sweet customer service!  Because I then felt pressure to hurry and up and not delay their closing for the night, I didn't get a good look at everything Sweet Ruby Jane's had to offer, but what I did see  was delectable.  Chocolate-covered strawberries, pretzels, cake pops, chocolate-covered Almond Rocha (my favorite candy!), peanut brittle, and more.  We chose a few of the pretzels, a cake pop, and a brownie pop--for a sugar addict like me, that's nothing.  I highly recommend this place for its freshly made sweets and the outstanding customer service--you know I'll be back, giving myself plenty of time to browse the selection and spend more on the sugar.","0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw",5,"2012-04-03",3,"review",2

I got a red velvet cake pop and some chocolate covered animal crackers.  Both were good.  I wish I would have got some of their chocolates, so I guess that is what I will get next time.

As Vijaya notes in her review, the donuts are yeast variety, which I don't usually like because of their consistency (I usually prefer the denser cake-donut variety). But here they do something to give the very light donut a bit of a crunch. I put it down to ""magic"".  Vijaya also notes that the Boston creme filling is spread, not injected - I see this as preferable to a big glob in one quarter of the donut, because you get creme in every bite.  To each their own, I guess. 

On my visits this summer, I was overjoyed to see BUTTER TARTS. I'd asked in prior years if they ever made them, and was told ""only around Christmas"", but by popular request they had them, and on special for $4.50 for 6!  These are not huge tarts, but they are excellent, and for comparable quality they would be twice the price at ""The Flaky Tart"" and other winning tart makers. I'm not a fan of raisins in my butter tarts, and P.U.B. makes them with and without, also a plus for me.","-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg",5,"2014-07-09",0,"review",1

For one, it's a neighborhood joint, family run. Also, the thought of local fresh baked goods was alluring, as I am a fiend for carbs. And, it's only a 10 minute drive from where I live, so total score right?

Well, here are my thoughts. I headed out this morning around 11 am to grab a doughnut or two. Prime time for baked goods, I would hope. They had quite the variety: Chocolate Dip, Vanilla Dip, Sugar, Cinnamon/Sugar Twist, etc. All were yeast based I thought, or at least not cake doughnut-like.

I chose the Boston Cream, and Dutchie. They both had crumbly textures and were on the drier side. Disappointing :(

I had anticipated the fluffy, chewy texture associated with a yeast doughnut, and was totally let down. May be they use baking powder/soda here instead? I don't know.
Moreover, the vanilla pudding/custard/cream in the Boston Cream was spread sparingly. No squishy, gooey goodness here.

I hate to say it, as I am one to root for the underdog, but Tim Hortons has better.

Every week draws a decent crowd so get there a bit earlier - and keep your fingers crossed for the passes you want. 

I find the staff here often times slow, and there seems to be a lot of staff just around - but it still feels inefficient. I've been around during closing time, and sometimes they decide to shut down sign out stations when big lines are forming at the checkouts- doesn't make sense. 

There is a decent section of dvds- lots of computer stations, study areas, different language books - large chinese section of materials (large asian population around that area) and  they have community workshops and courses here as well - which are good qualities of a library. They also have art for sale hanging on their walls - it's nice to see bits and pieces of the community here. 

The aura of the library isn't the best though. It's pretty dark in there. The children's area is great though - lovely area - lots of lights and windows, with an interactive area for kids! However, the rest of the library is generally pretty dimly lit, and has a ""cold"" feeling.

After many years of service, this public library has experienced abuse from its extensive children's reading section and the expanded computer lab where teenagers spend hours playing online games.

The library is definitely good if you have kids -- their children's section has a cute little reading area and they do have group reading events every once in a while. They carry lots of books on tape/CD, as well as movies on VHS and DVD that you would otherwise have to pay for at Blockbuster.

Another thing this library is good for is reading material in other languages -- they have a huge selection of books, magazines, and movies in Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as Urdu and other South Asian languages. They have a decent French section including a lot of expensive dictionaries, and they have a huge encyclopedia section upstairs.

They also have a couple good study areas if you need some peace and quiet, just go upstairs, away from the kids' section, and silence is yours. Their selection of reference books is much better than other Scarborough libraries, and they usually have a lot of the books in the library itself. They have computers exclusively for searching for materials and reserving them online, and the whole system is easy to use once you get the hang of it.

If you're in Scarborough, Agincourt Library is one of the best, and even if you're out of the neighbourhood, this library is decent if you want to actually bring the books home, since you have to leave the books at the Reference Library the way you found them.","3XBlOLsfH25eRHeV8guQBQ",4,"2008-11-10",2,"review",0

The library itself is a two story library that looks to have a large selection of books, but an embarrassingly low number of seats and tables. The place itself looks to be caught in between a vintage classic and a modern piece in work. The layout is a bit odd and  there didn't appear to be many computers readily available for you. 

The seating is probably the biggest issue with the library as there are a very limited number of seats. The lighting is also dim too, so you really have to find a light source in order to get some reading done. 

If you are able to find seating, don't let it go! The environment is actually quiet and you don't suffer from the noise that kids bring about (i do love kids though!...just not at a library) The parking in front of the library isn't bad, and it's situated near Agincourt Strip Mall so you might get some wanderers coming in and out.

Agincourt is my home  branch,  the one I have been to  the most and  well its one of better ones in area, It has pretty good collection, helpful staff thou I have ran into a few at circulation desk that have directed me to use book return when I came to desk to return because I wanted to pay a fine.

The main grip with this library is space and oulets, its an old library that due for renovation on second floor to make better use of the space to study, they do have booths on both floors but they are limited maybe 20 between both floor and maybe 6 or 7 tables most which arent close to outlet so you have to make due without. Usually people who grab those booth usually stay all day and leave their things to reserve the booth, they have signs about this but I cant see them enforcing without causing more problems.  They have fair bit of computers two areas, a learning center that should be quiet but you have occasional noise and other set by the elevator.

Noise overall isnt too bad, I havent seen the kids be too bad but kids are sometime not watched as they are left with grandparents  who might be in newspaper  section reading","3XBlOLsfH25eRHeV8guQBQ",4,"2015-03-01",1,"review",0

Many parents use it as a safe place to leave their kids, unattended, until they can pick them up after school. The result is too many children unsupervised in the adult section which makes for a noisy atmosphere.

 Additionally, people mistreat and abuse library property, including carving profanity onto the desks, thus making it look like a library that belongs in a ghetto. 

There is also the matter of immigrants who don't understand Western library etiquette. They troll around talking, speaking on mobile phones or via internet chat services, and eating ethnic foods that often contain a pungent odour which would make it even hard for dogs to concentrate. Furthermore, there is the loud chewing of the food, that is equivalent to a horse chewing hay.

Finally, there is the issue of not enough space, particularly quiet space. Your often left sharing desks with strangers, who in most cases don't understand Western etiquette (issues highlighted above).

Ultimately, this library is no longer worth using. Its better to buy a book via iBooks (iTunes) and read it in the comforts of your home , then it is to check a book out at this libray.","3XBlOLsfH25eRHeV8guQBQ",2,"2013-09-25",0,"review",0

One of my issues with gravitypope is customer service. Interestingly, I find the female staff to be very friendly and knowledgeable, but some of the males need training - I found two of them in particular to be very blasé and they each failed to provide a level of service that I would expect to see at a high-quality shop.

I tried on a pair of shoes and I was ready to buy, except that they were damaged (the leather was chipped on the side). Instead of offering me a discount or offering to repair them, my options were to: (a) buy the damaged shoes at full price or (b) go home. On principle alone, I went home. I then found the same pair of shoes online for $20 less and they were shipped to my home the following week. Win-win for me!

At the end of the day, this is a monopoly-type situation because there is no better selection of shoes in Toronto. The men's shoe and clothing selection is equally impressive as the women's and the prices are somewhat more reasonable for guys.","66m_zCy5JIDijS9F5OLC2A",3,"2015-09-03",0,"review",0

To my knowledge they biggest sale they have is like 10% or 15% off full priced items each year. I know, eh? I think twice a year they'll have 40% off sale, but the stuff I like is never on sale ... ANYWAY

Only going to talk about the men's shoes:

This store carries a great deal of both low-end and higher end shoes (mid-tier=churchs if you frequent SF). The thing about shoes in general is that most of the time, their price to quality ratio is pretty much on par. The more expensive the shoe is, the better quality it is (again, this is generally only for dress shoes).

That is true when it comes to high-end men's fashion, like Gaziano & Girling ($1500+), Crockett & Jones ($650+), Alden($500+), Carmina ($500+), and Allen Edmonds ($300 - 500). The aforementioned brands demonstrate QUALITY with an increasing price point.

However, this store carries some ""fashionable"" shoe brands like Mr. Hare, which is blake-welted shoe with corrected grain (I think) and priced at $900? That is ridiculous, considering I can buy a pair of Alden cordovans or Alfred Sargents for less money, which are both Goodyear Welted and far better quality! For example, they sell the brand ""Fluevog"", which seems to be cemented (sole is glued on / adhesive construction) for $300. That is preposterous! I can purchase a pair of Goodyear welted Allen Edmonds (full grain leather) for $300 when it's on sale (~4x a year in Toronto). The AE are better looking and the quality is exponentially better.

Secondly, some of the shoes here are out of date, namely some of the Church's styles. Note that Church's quality has fallen with being acquired by Prada.
*Edit: They keep both old and new stock.

Gravity Pope seem to not offer any discounts on their old stock if it's ""brand name"", like Arcteryx Veilance and Church's, even though if it's from the seasons before. They need to realize that other stores in Toronto are offering large markdowns on their old stock at the end of the season to bring in the new stock...like Harry Rosen. Gravity Pope needs to hire better pricing strategists because I personally feel much of the stuff will be hard to sell with the exuberant prices now.","66m_zCy5JIDijS9F5OLC2A",3,"2014-11-01",0,"review",0

The Suites are gorgeous - clean and modern and efficient. Our 3-bedroom suite had a spacious living room, dining area overlooking North Bridge, and a small but perfectly serviceable kitchen. The bedrooms are spacious yet cozy, with nice linens & plenty of space for your gear. For 3 people (one couple and one single), the price was right - less than 2 hotel rooms would have cost, and we got so much more.

We ate a variety of meals in: breakfast, some lunches, one dinner. Shopped for groceries at the nearby Sainsbury or only slightly farther away Tesco. So nice not to have to run to a restaurant anytime we were hungry. Reception staff is helpful and will guide you to where you need to go.

Highly recommended for a stay in Edinburgh if you want the flexibility and comforts of home, while still being centrally located (just 2 blocks from Waverly Street Bridge and the train station). Esp. good for families, as there's way more space than a hotel room or two.

Another plus: it's located about 1 minute walk from Calton Hill, a lovely little hillside park well worth a visit for a pleasant walk, interesting monuments, and outstanding views of Edinburgh. Howie's just up the street is a good restaurant for dinner, btw. And head up North Bridge for a wide selection of cheap eats (which we didn't discover until our last day).","1gMDCGRDP8KDvve-krHdmQ",5,"2011-04-13",2,"review",1

NEVER in my life did I think it would take me over 30 minutes to first place my order with one of the most incompetent cashiers I have ever seen in my 16 years of being in the service industry myself. I had to say 3 times to her alone what type of coffee I wanted, along with another 3 times to tell her I wanted it with ice. She then handed me the smallest hot coffee I have ever seen. She then, with an attitude the ENTIRE time, got a manager to come and help her. She then made me a coffee after I had to tell her twice as well what I wanted. She hands me two of the smallest ice coffees I have ever seen. I asked the cashier with an attitude if it was actually a medium because I am in shock as to how small it is. She grabs it out of my hand and holds the cup up while pointing to a small M on the side of it. I tasted both of the shit coffees they gave me. One tasted like chocolate milk and the other one tasted like straight espresso. What I ordered was two iced French Vanilla lattes, add mocha and add an extra turbo shot. I literally order this from a couple different McDonald's and know it's something they make. So. I then ask the bitch cashier to see a manager because at this point I'm just furious. She informs me the lady that made my coffees was my manager but her gm was also there. So I asked to speak to him. She stands there just yelling his name. I literally laughed to myself. The gm comes out from the back. He happens to be the man who I heard at the counter a few minutes before then telling the staff and pretty much anybody in there how he had to deal with another store being robbed of 487 dollars. Like. I'm an assistant gm. I have been a gm. You do NOT come in and act like that as a gm. I ask him if he can remake my coffee because they are not correct and taste like shit. I tell him what I want and he basically was telling me in a nut shell what I order at least 3 times a week, isn't possible. He luckily made me the coffees I asked for. And again with more attitude hands me my tiny ass little coffee. Then as I try to say thank you, he just pretends I'm not standing there and keeps commanding his lazy incompetent staff on where trash cans should be. Like come the fuck on Robert M. I think you paying attention to customer service, food times and what you're actual job entails rather than standing there bitching like a high school child. Literally no sooner did I turn around, another lady had come inside complaining about how she had been waiting 20 minutes for a caramel frappe. Somebody higher up needs to handle this store and teach their employees to have manners as well as know what they are supposed to be doing. It's common sense on how you treat people in restaurants, fast food or not. I will literally NEVER step foot into that place again and by the end of the day will be calling district managers and whoever else I can. I would recommend waiting at Dunkin Doughnuts where it would at least have been well worth the wait. Not feeling like I'm an inconvenience to somebody who is paid to do their job correctly and serve the customers who want what they paid for.

La quasi absence de trafic routier sur le site en fait un endroit très sécuritaire pour s'adonner à son sport préféré. À cause de son revêtement conçu expressément pour la course automobile, il s'agit de la route la mieux entretenue de Montréal. C'est aussi un bon endroit pour courir si l'on préfère les longs parcours plats. À vélo, l'endroit est accessible par la piste cyclable du pont de la Concorde via le vieux Montréal. Pour le roller-blade ou la course à pied, je vous suggère d'utiliser le métro ou le pont Jacques Cartier. 

Bien sûr, la semaine du grand-prix, le circuit fait place aux amateurs de F1. Il devient donc inaccessible aux cyclistes et autres promeneurs. L'endroit devient bondé de touristes internationaux attirés par l'atmosphère glamour du grand cirque de la F1. À ce moment, les prix de la restauration sur l'île frôlent le ridicule. Je conseil aux amateurs de course d'apporter un gouter, ce qui vous fera économiser beaucoup. Malgré cela, l'Île Notre-Dame reste la destination F1 la plus abordable au monde !

They have 10-12 different flavors ranging from fruity ones like strawberry, raspberry, pineapple to more decadent ones like french vanilla, banana cream, dark chocolate. The toppings rock as well--fresh fruit! None of that sugary fruit mix from a can that's swimming in syrup but fruit like blackberries, kiwi, blueberries and strawberries at their peak. And to top it all off-Ghirardelli syrups like caramel and chocolate plus they have punch cards that you can get punched for each visit, oh yeah!!

The ""do-it-yourself"" frozen yogurt concept is a great idea, on many levels.  First, being able to make your own allows you to customize to your liking...no ""ummm-ing and ahhh-ing"" over a menu board.  It saves time in the line too!  You don't like what you got?  Can't complain to management, because you did it to yourself!  The topping bar is filled with all the typical favorite candy and chocolate toppings, as well as freshy fruit and nuts, if you are inclined to the more healthy options.  I am not, and promptly turned my cup of yogurt into a trip to Willy Wonka's magical chocolate factory.

Which brings me to my next point...it is easy for someone like me to get carried away in a place like this.  What starts out as a tiny cup of ice cream can turn into an $8 hayday supermarket sweep once you hit the topping bar!  But, once again...you can't complain about the price, because pricing is by weight.  You don't like what you're paying?  Get less!

When I told my friends where I was going for dinner, I was met with furrowed brows of confusion.  ""Dane? Like the Great Dane?""  Admittedly, I was not familiar with the city or its citizens either, but I had heard great things about this little bar called Tootsie's and their inventive, and at times risky cuisine.  I found out quickly that  this little hometown gem was worth the back-country trek. 

 From the outside, this place looks like your standard dive bar, and honestly, it's appearance on the inside does too.  There are several tables set up for dining and a singular pool table lurking in the corner.  All of these things are fairly standard,  but what makes Tootsie's special is the proprietor, employees, and patrons.  We were there on a weekday night and the place was just banging.  Each person sitting at the bar was friendly and inviting.  Drinks were flowing and the party was on.  The owner was walking around and talking to everyone and the bartender and chef were equally amiable.  

What was even more impressive was the food.  Tootsie's surprisingly houses a full kitchen in the back of the bar, making it possible to provide high end daily specials to patrons. The night we were there the special was  roasted quail and smoked pork belly.  We had the choice of picking either of the options or a combination of both. My dining partner and I opted for one of each.  Usually I'm very critical of the way restaurants cook each of these proteins.  Pork belly is one of those foods, along with duck breast, that is ruined for me without proper rendering.  At Tootsie's it was cooked perfectly, and was served in a large meaty portion. Yum.  The quail was cooked to perfection, boasting moist morsels of meat.  

Wait....hold on...I forgot one major thing: the ranch.  

Some people (my husband included) look down on me for my love of ranch dressing, but I stand proud with my obsession.  I will eat anything dipped in this herbed mayonnaise sauce.  The chef at Tootsie's brought me out TWO different kinds of ranch to use on my salad and side dishes, and I was in heaven.  For me, the ranch alone is worth the trip. 

Overall, go to Tootsie's with your expectations in check.  This small bar will most likely win you over the same way it wooed me.  It was a fun trip out to the country for this city girl, and I plan on making it many many more times.","29uk0fZJAWdSQhWhasYI9A",5,"2014-12-30",1,"review",0

We never heard from them after our trial until one week prior to our rehearsal dinner. They were asking about final details. Even though we hadn't heard from them in 5 months.

Secondly the guy playing the accordion went to every table asking people to give him a tip. For me and my partner this was a really awkward interruption. 

Thirdly, the owner asked me the exact same thing as the first time I went ""are you chinese? I love chinese people, my son's best friend is chinese"".

en passant, le coupon est d'une valeur de 15$.... pas 50$ ( me semble que pour 15$ tu ne fais pas d'histoire si tu es un restaurateur intelligent)
en plus, il se met à raconter notre cas a tous le monde dans le resto... juste pour que tout le monde parle juste de ca super fort pour qu'on ait l'air super cheap.
Ok je lui dit de pas faire d'histoire avec ca et que je ferai une plainte a Resto boom, il me dit : ""ecoute je le connais le gars de Resto boom, c'est mon ami!""

A few months ago in the Glasgow branch I saw a gorgeous black dress with white lace down the front, they didn't have my size but the girl was helpful and wrote down the code for me so I could try other Republics. I called another Glasgow branch but the girl wasn't very helpful and even though they had my size she told me that they don't have a policy of putting things aside so by the time I went in my size was sold out again. After that, I got bored of trying to hunt down the dress and let it slip to the back of my mind but whenever I had a night out I wished it was in my wardrobe. Last week I was in this branch of Republic and saw the dress again, I was so surprised that it was still in stock and they had my size and it had £5 off! I couldn't believe it...

I have researched and experienced this for the first time myself and it is NORMAL but can be time consuming. Ideally, bring your car in at least a month sooner (if possible) before the inspection to correct the check engine issue. This can save you and the mechanical specialists a lot of time and hassle.

"3056",2,"kc-rnN-ndnFTdHG4TfIgeQ","Oo8egThPflfYLKE7XiDoDQ","Welp.  Its unavoidable to compare Chez Nous on Grand with Char's over on 7th Ave, so I will do a dual-analysis of these spots.

THE ATMOSPHERE:
Char's is just a friendlier place.  Their doorman doesn't DEMAND his $5 like a put-out paperboy.  Chez's does.  Its kind of annoying and unsettling as your introduction to a night of hi-falutin drinking and lo-falutin boogieing.  Char's clientle seems to be in higher spirits and more polite as well.  Chez's are chilly.  Burrr.  If you stand in front of their seat to order a drink from the bar (because they went to go dance or something) they will let you know that you may NOT continue to stand there, even for a second.  The bartenders at both places are sweet and quick about their service.

THE DRINKS:
Weak at both places, but IIRC, they are cheaper at Chez.  The no-card policy at Chez is a nuisance, so Char's is preferable here.  They both serve the typical booze and beer, so nothing really stands out other than the cost (Chez cheaper) and the convenience (Char's takes card).

THE MUSIC:
They are both MANIACALLY cool spots for some soul-funk-blues and great dance floors to boot.  This is the main reason to but up with any inconveniences, small or large, at either place.  

THE SET-UP:
Just packed at both places.   If you want to come at a decent hour, you won't get a seat.  So, just forget about it.  Both buildings are pretty neat setups.  Chez is more of a railroad-style-room, and Chars more of a dance-hall set up.  Both have smoking patios, though Char's is small and quaint with tables and a busy atmosphere, while Chez's is (assuming) not complete and barren but large.  

OVERALL:
Char's Has the Blues AND the lead over Chez due to the fact that I can't seem to get over the vibe that I don't belong to ""The Secret Club"" ...shhhhh ... over at Chez.  But whatever, the drinks, music, and dancing will get me going at either place.","FbmeJQ3-fP_BozmNPLfx1w",3,"2008-01-29",4,"review",3

parking was horrible. the door man kinda gave me the creeps with his long leather jacket and insistence on shaking my hand..and the eagerness to shove a flyer in my hand as i was already halfway out the door. i kinda like jazz, groove and funk. but this place also served up a healthy dose of grope, gawk, and funk..not of the musical variety.

i can say i will not be returning here. it just didn't really offer any appeal to me. but at least i gave it a chance. 

my expectations were already low since i knew this place used to be Fat Cats, and you could score some crack rock in the parking lot faster then you could catch yourself if you tripped. i suspect the same can still be obtained, but i think they had the dealers checked to stay in their car...because i did spot a couple sitting in their cutlass in the parking lot. sketch.

Everything - and I mean everything is just how I remembered: The long bar; the line of cushioned booths along the wall; the wall of rock water feature behind the bar; the only light provided by super dim wall fixtures reminiscent of the late 19th century; the vintage velour wallpaper (now sans the yellowing and 45+ years of old cigarette smoke); the 70s soundtrack- it was all here! 

We determined it was slightly smaller than the OG location, but setup almost identically, save for a certainly separate entry room - which, p.s. contained an ATM (this bar is cash only) AND an old school black-and-white photo booth ( a real one, that gives you actual photo-paper print outs). 

There was a live band on *Wednesday* night - and they weren't half bad. They won my heart by opening with an instrumental cover of Ms. Jackson (if you're nasty)'s That's The Way Love Goes. Wonderful. Sadly, the special was $3 shots of purple hooter and some other shot I can't recall because i instantly began musing on my other options as soon as I heard ""hooter"" (it's a weeknight, for chrissakes - what am i? 22?). I believe thurs is 2-for-1 ladies night, too bad we missed that. So, me and the G settled for our mutual love of (well) G&Ts for $4 a pop. I believe draft beers were $3.50, imports $5 and top shelf up to $8.

But we stuck to the G&T, which our barmaid was kind enough to pack a helluva punch in. just three and I was already planning my ipod song list for the ride home (not alarmingly in and of itself, but my chosen songs were a tell-tale sign of drunkenness: lionel Richie/all night long; Britney spears/Gimme More; ToTo/Africa...you get the idea). she was also kind enough to come out to our table when she noticed we were getting low to replenish our liquids.

It is with the most utmost regret that inform you that you're choice of after party venues was teh suck. And no, I did not misspell ""the"". That's how we say it these days. Get with the times, sucka.

But seriously, wtf?

Through what twisted logic did you come to the conclusion that the best way to top off a birthday party at fez laden with free appetizers, cake, and drink specials was an over-priced, overcrowded jazz bar...on a Saturday night?

Now before I go any further, I shall confess to you that I was spared the $7 dollar charge. My friend and I managed to talk the doorman down to $4 for the two of us. Perhaps he was desperate to get more ladies into the establishment. Perhaps he's just a chump.

In either case, you'll be interested to know that while waiting in the parking lot for my friend's boyfriend to show up, I witnessed the doorman using your $7 to help pay for a pizza and hot sandwich from Dominos. 

Unlike some of the other ladies in our party, I will not complain about the ass-grabbing and creepy smiles I received. Because I didn't receive any. No, menacing glares and bathroom gossip was my lot. Feeling that my safety was in jeopardy, I was compelled to make a hasty exit in the middle of the chorus of ""Ladies Night"". 

I'm not going to fault you for inviting me to a totally UN-safe space (because maybe I should've done some research before I took you up on it), but if you were a vegan I wouldn't invite you to a place that I knew had no vegan-friendly options. I'm going to leave it at that.

And I'm not going to expect you to ask all of us our age, but please be aware that there are a great number of us who were NOT products of the 70's and have little use for disco and gold chains. 

The average patron had to be at least 10 years older and 20 years more behind on fashion than even you'd ever tolerate in a date. I take solace in the knowledge that you were just as unlucky as I would be (if I was single and into cougars, that is).

I know that the overall cost of Chez Nous might seem a little exaggerated, considering we just had free appetizers and cake at FEZ, but nothing ruins a birthday party afterglow like inane ATM fees and greedy, smooth-talking doormen.

Regardless, I want you to know that despite my displeasure with your recent choice of after-party locales, I still love you. 

In fact, I'm grateful to you, in my own way. It's so hard to be funny and snarky when you're writing a 4-5 star review of a place. In a time where my ability to nitpick and rant, it's refreshing to finally find a place so terrible I am justified in my neurosis. 

In the event that all of this is too wordy and convoluted to understand, I've made you a chart.

I was afraid after being essentially forced out of their old, infamous and ""historic"" digs at 7th Ave and Indian School Rd, that things would never be the same. I am very happy (and relieved) to report otherwise.

Now, I will always miss the old locale. But folks, the new spot's interior is essentially identical to the old one. I was pleasantly surprised to see so much of the old bar was preserved (or atleast well recreated). From it's famous dark velvet wallpaper to it's leather booths and compact dance floor, I am impressed with the new Chez Nous. The owners did a great job.

And, my perceived silver lining - it's new location - is definitely better. It's much, much closer to downtown Phoenix (9th and Grand Avenues), walking distance to other popular watering holes of the downtown set (Bikini Lounge, for example). It's in the center of the monthly First Friday's hubbub, along Grand Avenue; an area ripe with revitalization and promise. Overall, I'd say it's a plus. If it's still open in 5 years, I'm sure it'll be one of the most popular spots in the neighborhood.

Anyone who frequents downtown's already very popular bar scene should obviously pay a visit; however more importantly, those who used to frequent the old Chez Nous that now may not, should obviously start going again, as well.

They were previously located at the corner of 7th Ave and Indian School, but were forced to move last year to make way for a Fresh and Easy. Although I never visited the original location, those that have say the new location is virtually identical in decor to the original.

The bar itself is quite small and intimate. Booths line one wall, bar tables populate the middle, and the bar itself runs nearly the length of the other wall. Live music is apparently a regular event at Chez Nous. The night I went, a jazz/soul band was performing. I like live music, but often times the performers are not that great, especially in a smaller venue. This group was actually quite good, and their music made the evening all that more enjoyable. Although there is no formal dance floor, people danced in the available space.

The drinks are reasonably priced, and the bartenders friendly. Although I walked there, the parking lot appeared large enough to accommodate a good sized crowd. Support your community/neighborhood bars!","FbmeJQ3-fP_BozmNPLfx1w",3,"2009-01-25",0,"review",1
"3070",11,"AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ","a0epNtWYUvGzo5xn0Yy3ww","Chez Nous, I want to write you a love song...

...a love song which describes how I had completely underestimated how much I missed you until I set foot inside your premises after 6 long months apart. Months that felt like years. But the moment I set foot in that door I immediately felt like I was home. My shoulders relaxed. My breathing eased up. I felt like my soul just got a massage. 

....a love song which describes my complete amazement upon walking inside on how much of the old you is still there with the new you. Wallpaper? Check. Lounge seats? Check. Wall fixtures? Lamps? Disco ball? Dancefloor? Low lights (and I mean LOW lights)? Cheap tinsel lining the ceiling? Check x 6. So now the bar is on the left instead of the right, but I don't mind. You're obviously still you, and that's all that matters.

...a love song about the fact that the crowd inside tonight was just like the crowd inside the old you every night. Black, white, brown, yellow, green. It didn't matter then what color you were, and it sure as hell doesn't matter now. Everyone is chill. Everyone is relaxed. Everyone is cool. No airs. No pretense. No scene. Even the huge guy wearing the white full-length fur coat with matching white fur hat and white patent leather shoes and bling on every finger. Coolest, chillest guy in the room - just enjoying himself and having a great time and friendly to everyone. 

...a love song which exemplifies the glories of the drinks and the service. Drinks? Still dirt cheap. Service? Still completely & genuinely friendly. Never once makes you feel like for some reason you're not cool enough to belong there.

...a love song which shows my great appreciation for the music. The funk and R&B is back, people. ""Let's Stay Together"", your perennial classic, followed by ""You Dropped A Bomb On Me"", followed by ""Word Up"", followed by ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,"" followed by....""Jailhouse Rock?!?"" Yes, it did happen. And tonight, you did the impossible. You made me get up. And then you made me get down. Down on the dancefloor. That's right. Me doing my own brand of jive. For the first time since I've been in Arizona. 2 years, and it came down to being in the new you to compel me to bust out some moves. Now I wouldn't say I have mad skillz with the way I move. Might be reminiscent of the African Anteater Ritual. But who cares? You never did.

...and last but not least...

...a love song about how you actually came back to me. And to everyone else who loved you. How you simply didn't just throw your hands up in the air and call it quits. How you persisted and moved forward. How volunteers toiled day and night moving as much from your old location to the new one to make everyone feel comfortable from the moment they walked in. How you have truly pulled a Phoenix and have risen from the ashes. How I'll admit that driving by the empty lot on 7th Ave and Indian School was a depressing experience, but no more. 

Because you're back.

Because you're one of my favorite spots. Anywhere.

Because I hope you never have to go away again. 

Because whatever your detractors say, you truly are a Phoenix legend.

Can't I pay the cover if I go in, hang for a while, & decide if it's worth the money? I think my friend Julie P. might have paid my cover just to shut me up. Not sure, but thanks if you did.

Then I remember the bar only took cash, my rad friend Ayesha got me a drink. Ayesha is also awesome & carries cash.

I busted out with my scary, cool dance moves most of the time I was there & I have fuzzy memories of a lot of the rest.

I do remember having a hard time getting my drunk ass some water from the bartender. I got the vague impression she doesn't like people, or just drunk chicks who want water. Sue me, I was thirsty.

Tja, was soll ich sagen - auf Stuttgarts architektonischer Gruselmeile namens Heilbronner Straße fiel mir irgendwann das Altbauensemble positiv auf, und das Design des Eingangs wirkte ansprechend. Und es waren auch nirgends verwertbare Kritiken zu finden... Und so fanden wir uns heute im Weissenhof wieder, nachdem der Tafelberg keinen Platz für uns hatte.
 
Bei der telefonischen Reservierung bat ich um einen schönen Tisch und wurde gleich gefragt, ob es ein besonderer Anlaß sei - meine Antwort war nein, wir hätten nur gerne was am Fenster oder am Rand und nicht direkt im Getümmel. Wurde vermerkt und auch erfüllt, wäre angesichts der sehr übersichtlichen Besetzung an einem Freitagabend nicht wirklich nötig gewesen.
 
Der Eingang zum Restaurant ist identisch mit Hotel und Bar, man steigt außen die Stufen hoch und wird hinter den Türen gleich von einem riesigen Kronleuchter begrüßt, der - zumindest heute abend - pink angestrahlt war. Hinter dem Kronleuchter ging eine Innentreppe gleich weiter in den Hotelbereich, rechts und links von dieser landete man an der Bar mit ledergepolsterten Bänken und dunkelbraunen Tischen zu beiden Seiten, rechts biegt man ins Restaurant ab. Die Farbstellung ist creme-braun, laut Karte zitiert man - Überraschung - die Weissenhofsiedlung, deshalb auch der eher gewöhnungsbedürftige braun-beige gemusterte Teppich im Restaurant, das farblich ebenfalls in cremefarbenen Leder und dunklem Holz gehalten war. Ja, und da geht's schon los, warum haben Hotelrestaurants immer Teppichboden? Und gruselige abgehängte Decken? Und eine Beleuchtung, wie sie kein normales Restaurant installieren würde? Fragen über Fragen, unfair, weil ja, wir sind im Hotel.
 
Der bei weitem angenehmste Teil des Hotel-Seins war der Service. Der war umwerfend, freundlich, souverän, unaufdringlich, eine gelungene Interaktion mit dem Gast, weder servil noch desinteressiert. Könnte ich dafür sechs Sterne geben, jederzeit sofort. Also ganz, ganz großes Kompliment! Und wirklich schöne Überraschung war die Aperitiv-Empfehlung Trollinger brut, ein außerordentlicher Schaumwein, der mit meinem Trollinger-Alptraum von der IHK absolut nichts gemeinsam hat. Mit € 5,90 für 0,1 l aber auch sehr anspruchsvoll in der Preislage. Brot kam zügig, nicht schlecht, aber es fehlte an Knusprigkeit. Die Butter dazu war eiskalt, keine ideale Kombination. Verwunderlicherweise kein Gruß aus der Küche, hätte ich bei einem Restaurant mit diesem Anspruch eigentlich erwartet.
 
Die Karte ist eher klein, man wirbt mit Schwäbisch / Österreichisch (österreichisch das Menü, die Fleischgerichte und ein paar Nachspeisen), zwischendurch einige Einsprengsel nicht ganz eindeutiger Provenienz zwischen Crossover und Büffelmozzarella. Eine Handvoll Vorspeisen (Carpaccio von der Maultasche, Beef Tartar), zwei Suppen, dreimal Fisch (gedämpfter Viktoriabarsch, Zander mit Paprikapolenta), zweimal Vegetarisch (Erdäpfel-Schwammerl-Gulasch, Topfen/Kraut), vier oder fünf Fleischgerichte (Tafelspitz, Kalbsrahmgulasch), ebensoviele Desserts.
Wirklich sehr gute Weinauswahl mit Schwerpunkt Ba-Wü und Ö, ungewöhnlich, exzellent und - pardon - schweineteuer. 1/8 Weiß vom exklusiveren Teil der Karte war bei € 6,20 bis 7,90, zugegeben, die Weine waren außergewöhnlich mit Empfehlung auf den Weingütern Currle und Hager (die günstigeren fingen bei  € 2,90 das Achtel an, aber wir waren probierwütig), aber bei € 6,60 für 0,75 l Vösslauer Mineralwasser medium würde ich mich sehr gerne mal mit dem Controller unterhalten.
 
Mein Mann nahm das österreichische Menü mit schwäbischem Einschlag, erst Flädlesuppe (nein, nicht Frittatensuppe, Frittaten seien knuspriger als Flädle, hieß es), dann Wiener Schnitzel mit Kartoffelsalat, etwas Feldsalat und Preißelbeeren, zum Schluß Kaiserschmarrn mit Zwetschgenkompott und Apfelmus. Ich war konzeptlos und nahm den Papayasalat mit Thunfisch (drei Würfel Thunfisch, einmal mit Petersilie, einmal kroß natur, einmal mit Leinsamen, alle drei innen noch roh, tolle Qualität), das Dressing sehr neutral bis geschmacksarm, einzig belebt von ein paar Blättchen Thai-Basilikum. Die gute Produktqualität ließ die fehlende Originalität verzeihen. Flädlesuppe war eher auf der salzigen Seite und laut meiner besseren Hälfte nichts besonderes.
 
Danach die organisatorische Herausforderung, ich hatte die Kukuruzsuppe und anschließend den ganzen Saibling mit Petersilienkartoffeln bestellt, mein Mann eben Hauptgang und Dessert, die salomonische Lösung war, mir die Suppe separat zu bringen, fand ich auch besser als wenn der Saiblingduft zum Kaiserschmarrn rüberzieht.

Als Hauptgang hatten wir Wiener Schnitzel und Zwiebelrostbraten. Gerade das Schnitzel war ein Hochgenuss - wir haben es inzwischen dreimal probiert und es lässt nicht nach. Der Kartoffelsalat ist dabei nicht nur Beilage, sondern ein Gaumenschmaus an sich. Auch die Maultaschen können hier überzeugen.
Ein weiteres Highlight: gelbe Paprikasuppe mit Garnele. Und der Brotkorb mit den drei verschiedenen Dips ist so gut, dass man schon vor dem Essen fast satt ist.

Es folgte eine Spinatcremesuppe: Wenn ich sie mit geschlossenen Augen gegessen hätte, hätte ich den Spinat nicht geschmeckt. Viel Sahne und Würzmittel eben.

Das Restaurant empfängt in einem modernen, modischen aber dennoch attraktiven, wenn auch etwas kühlem Ambiente. Die Begrüßung war freundlich, professionell und effizient. Das Restaurant empfiehlt sich selbst als Restaurant einer österreichisch-schwäbischen Küche und so fiel die Wahl für den Test auf das Wiener Schnitzel, das auf der Speisekarte als ""Wiener Schnitzel vom Stauffenberg-Kalb mit Erdäpferl-Vogerlsalat"" präsentiert wird und nach eigener Wahl durch ein Glas Grünen Veltliner Federspiel begleitet werden sollte. Nun, ein Glas des Weines reichte zur Begleitung nicht, da zwischen Bestellung und Servieren des Schnitzels rund 90 Minuten vergingen. Die viel zu lange Wartezeit wurde durch zwei kleine Scheibchen Weißbrot überbrückt, was sehr schwer fiel. Das Schnitzel selbst war eher ein Schnitzelchen und entsprach nicht ganz den Erwartungen an ein wirklich gutes Wiener Schnitzel. Und auch der Erdäpferl-Vogerlsalat war ok, aber nicht wirklich sehr gut, alles zum Preis von rund 22 Euro. Das von der Begrüßung bekannte Servicepersonal war mittlerweile auch schon verschwunden und man hatte auch nach dem Servieren den Eindruck, ""vergessen"" worden zu sein. 

Fazit: Wenn man im Hotel übernachtet und den Fußweg in die Innenstadt scheut, kann man bei nicht zu hoch gesteckten Erwartungen, das Restaurant besuchen. In umgekehrter Richtung lohnt sich nach unserer Einschätzung der Weg jedoch nicht!","5sphAhVL85z6QW4dCjwCUg",3,"2013-05-30",0,"review",0

Location:
- Sehr schönes und gemütliches Ambiente und super Lage (Stuttgart, nähe Hauptbahnhof)
Essen:
- Original Wiener Schnitzel vom Kalb mit Erdäpfel(Kartoffel)salat und Preiselbeer (siehe Bild)
Preis/Leistung:
- 22,50EUR / Sehr gut
Fazit:
- Mein (bisher) bestes ORIGINAL Wiener Schnitzel.
Preislich liegt der ganze Spass im gehobenen Bereich  sollte er aber auch. Ein ordentliches Schnitzel kommt aus der Kalbs-Oberschale. Die meisten Wiener Schnitzel im Kostenbereich von 12-17EUR sind oft aus der Kalbs-Hüfte oder -Nuss, das ist geschmacklich und Qualitativ ein enormer Unterschied. Wie auch immer, hab selten ein solch rundes und leckeres Schnitzel verspeist.

What I REALLY dislike. The city allows frisbee teams to use the park. However, the traffic is awful on these days. Most of these people do not live in our area and do not care about driving slow, safely and keeping an eye out for neighborhood children.

There isn't much foliage or any real shade around the park, which seems to be a huge problem with the parks in this area. You may find yourself caught out in the heat with no where to hide if you're out for a run or with the kids.

The outer perimeter of the park is surrounded by prairie grass, which sets the park apart from the rest of the neighborhood and keeps it contained. I do not recommend letting pets or children in this grass because deer ticks are heavy this time of the season. There is also an adjacent forested area. There have been several coyote and fox sightings in the area lately so be careful with small kids and pets when it gets dark.

Most of the park is just a large open green space. The large open space is great for kite flying, playing frisbee, football, soccer, etc. Unfortunately, the park is missing a few things that I appreciate such as a large running trail, drinking fountains, and sufficient trashcans.

Like most Madison parks, dogs are not allowed. Tickets have been given out so please keep your dog leashed and contained to the outer perimeter. Despite this rule, I have noticed several people with their larger dogs off leash using the park to exercise.

The park isn't the best, but it's a large neighborhood park that you can have a nice afternoon at. I just wish they would plant more trees along the path and near the play area.","5eXvBuIO_IWAqMNLn9Ryxw",3,"2015-07-09",2,"review",0

There is a basketball court and some playground equipment, but the main attraction is just a nice, open area to hang out in. My boyfriend and I ended up there on graduation weekend when we wanted to enjoy some time in the sun but didn't want to brave the Terrace or other over-populated venues.

The park was almost totally dead - there was one family by the playground but that's it. It offered a nice and relaxing afternoon where we could play some music and not feel like we were disturbing anyone. Things keeping the park from getting over three stars are that there are no bathroom facilities (so many parks lack them, which is awkward if you're there for any length of time) and it's very exposed - both in that there's no shade and that you're surrounded by houses. I can't knock North Star for what it is, but we'll probably keep an eye out for some more foliage-heavy spots in the future.","5eXvBuIO_IWAqMNLn9Ryxw",3,"2015-06-04",1,"review",1

The day began with a pickup at my hotel... usually, they operate many of small shuttles to pick up people and bring them to ""master"" hotel where there's a big bus waiting.  Then we headed over to Valley of Fire (which obviously was a misnomer as there was no fire).

The tour folks make you sign waiver forms during the bus ride, so no time is wasted when you actually arrive.  You pick up the necessary safety equipment and hop onto the ATV for quick safety and operating lesson.  After that, off you go out to the desert!

What I really liked about this tour is that the actual riding time is quite long (over 2 hours... website says 2.5 hours).  Because the tour is geared for novice, there is no extreme condition that you have to trek through... but, there was relatively wide stream of water we had to cross and we also did some hill climbings.  Lunch is provided at one of several rest stops the tour makes.

It was incredibly convenient as it is right off I-30/90/94, a slightly easier drive and definitely better located destination than Madison West (which isn't even in Madison).

It's situated in a heavily trafficked and traveled area but I slept like a baby, so you won't have to worry about too much noise. It's also just across the freeway from a large shopping center and many nearby restaurants and stores. You'll have no problem picking up any essential items you may have forgotten and grabbing a bite to eat even if it's late at night.

It's about a 20-30 minute drive from Downtown Madison, which is where we went for dinner and had to pass through to get to the Ragnar starting line. We really appreciated how close it was to the starting point because it allowed Van #1 to sleep in a little bit more than when we stayed at Madison East's sister hotel. It was also perfect for Van #2 because it let them sleep in a bit later because it was much closer to checkpoint #6. Everyone was a winner!

That they would have a pool and hot tub didn't even cross my mind, so I'll be sure to pack my swim suit if I ever return here.

Points taken away for the shower that wouldn't drain properly. However, bonus points for giving us free toiletries when we realized we had forgotten some.","3kQarjSJYYo9nGAkFjbWYg",4,"2013-08-20",5,"review",2

As soon as you walked into my room, there's this scent that just reminded you of an old man's cologne. It didn't smell sexy. It didn't smell manly. Hell, my grandpa, bless his soul, smelled better than that. However, yeah.. Very oaky musky euwy smell. 

I have to say though...it was my first time smelling it. I have stayed here before and I don't recall to ever smell it in the past. Maybe the guest before me used his cologne for room freshener. I don't know.

Otherwise, this hotel is okay. It's newer Fairfield Inns so it's still pretty nice. It is next to a Courtyard but for some reasons, Madison hotel prices can get out of whacked expensive. Like tonight, there's about $40 bucks difference in price between the two hotels. I usually stay at Fairfield when Courtyard is too pricy or full. It's really not much difference as far as comfort when the Fairfield is not old and dumpy.

This location has a gym as well. Some Fairfield will send you to a nearby local gym since they don't have it in the facility.

Front desk staff, once I was there it was fine. I tried to cancel one of the rooms I booked for my coworker, and that was an ordeal.

She asked me for my number and she kept repeating the wrong number like she couldn't hear what I said. She was also impatient about it so I told her never mind and I would call the 800 number. I did and got it taken care of. It was still pretty crappy though.

However, in overall, it is not a bad hotel. It's decent okay hotel and it is easy to get to, right off the highway. Hopefully my next stay the room will smell more like lavender than old man scent. That would be preferable.","3kQarjSJYYo9nGAkFjbWYg",3,"2015-01-23",3,"review",2

I went to Sam's Cafe last night with two of my girlfriends and based on my previous experience at the downtown location, I figured we'd get a pretty decent meal.  Not the case!

Carter, our server, was awful.  I hate to be so hard on him but as soon as he took our drink order and we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, he went downhill from there.  My friend Allyson ordered the rotisserie chicken special and I ordered the applewood smoked pecan salmon.  DeDe had a few question before she decided and Carter not only had no clear answers for her, he didn't bother to try to get the answers.  Unacceptable!  (Just to clarify, these were basic questions such as 'what kind of vegetables come on the fire grilled vegetable tacos?' and 'What is the marinade for the chicken fajitas?')  

The next thing we know, we are given their special chips and salsa... I love how they combine sweet and salty in a colorful arrangement!  Those were delicious.  However, it was a good ten minutes until we saw our water and when you are eating salty chips and salsa, it's nice to have something to wash it down with!  Minus star #2.

So, our food comes and DeDe's fajitas are totally different than what Carter explained.  She isn't bitchy about sending them back but kindly asks for just the chicken and vegetables on a plate since that is what she was expecting.  This is where the 3rd missing star comes in - I am not kidding when I tell you that DeDe did not get her food until after both Allyson and I were done eating ours (and we were eating really slow)!  It was not right... and Carter was not very apologetic.  He came over to offer us a free dessert but being that we are all in healthy eating mode, we declined.  They did take the fajitas off the bill in the end, but it was expected at this point.

So, I know it was just one bad experience, but if I feel like Sam's Cafe again, I will probably head to the downtown location or just have lower expectations in the future.

Bottom line:  decent meal + bad service = 2 stars!","0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA",2,"2008-01-17",1,"review",3

It's one of those places that's relatively convenient, has decent parking, and can handle larger crowds since they don't ever seem to be even remotely busy.

I will agree that when I have been there with small, personal groups, service has been unbearably slow. They would definitely earn one more star if there were even a whiff of concern... but when the group is larger, we have always received exemplary service - dare I say size does matter?

The food is actually above standard, for its kind. I love the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast (it has lots of goat cheese inside and is covered in their red pepper cream sauce - which honestly I think would be good spread over an old leather sneaker). I could eat the Adovo Chicken Pasta twice a week and never get tired of it (same reference to red pepper cream sauce). My ex swore that the Meatloaf was the best (but really, what can't be improved by a generous portion of bacon?!!). And my all time favorite has to be Chile Rubbed Sirloin - it's flavorful, without being overpowering, always cooked exactly as requested, and generally requires the threat of forking when others realize that ""it looks better than mine.""

If you like Margaritas. You should be happy with what Sam's has to offer. The Orange Beso makes my toes tingle. Fortunately, they limit those to two servings - otherwise I might find myself behaving badly. They have several ""house margaritas"" all of which I've enjoyed (really it's not my fault, I work with a lot of social alcoholics... it's the only way to deal with the stress).

My final offering is that this particular location (I haven't ever tried at the others, so they might be accommodating as well), is great for private functions. They will basically close down whatever portion of the restaurant you might need, either feed you buffet style or from the menu, work with you on drink coupons, let you hang corporate flair, etc.  If you are in a pinch for a business gathering in a relaxed environment give it a try.","0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA",3,"2008-09-13",4,"review",2

The waitress was very attentive and dropped by many times to make sure we were fine. The chips and salsa were amazing! I saw some Yelp reviews on my phone that talked about the chips. I thought really? They are chips! Can they really be that exciting? Damn skippy! In fact, most of the time I didn't even put them in salsa-  they were so good just by themselves. 

My friend ordered the Red Rock Meatloaf served with peppers, bacon and onions, mashed potatoes and she swapped spinach in place of the corn on the cob. I went with the Applewood Smoked Pecan Salmon.

Happy because we hadn't been there in a while and happy because Sam's has improved since the last time we were there:)
I say ""judge slowly"" and ""give people a second chance"" and ""a stitch in time, saves nine"" and all kinds of other inappropriate adages...but my point is that sometimes a second chance is in order.
Sam's Café had been in the rotation for a few years and then we had a couple of poor experiences there, and just didn't go back...you know how it is...there's a lot of competition for the dining dollar (it used to be ""dollars"" but the recession/depression has hit everyone!).
But, this isn't about then...it's about now, so let's get up to date, shall we?
The Beautiful Carin and I headed for the club last Saturday to sweat off the weeks caloric build up and sweat it off we did! (you know, I think I sweat so much because I come from ice age survivor stock and here I am trying to live in the desert!).
Anyway, after we finished our extremely grueling, yet fulfilling programs of physical exercise, got ourselves all cleaned up, (lookin' good and smellin' sweet) we were talking between ourselves (as married people often do) and trying to figure how to reward ourselves for the excellent workouts we had just finished.
How about a nice big lunch?
Sam's Café has Happy Hours on Saturday's and Sunday's that run from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm. 
Well, that's just inspired!
We tottered in and sat at the bar (I think that's going to be a defining happy hour ""move"" for us), and the barman greeted us with a warmth and enthusiasm normally reserved for long lost play cousins...a good start:)
We looked at the happy hour menu and they have some nice selections for really good prices.
We ordered roast pork sliders with a chipotle barbecue sauce, Carin's  ""go-to"" selection...grilled chicken nacho's and Sedona Spring Rolls (also served with the chipotle barbecue sauce and pico de gallo).
While were waiting for the food to arrive, Sam's minions brought us more food...chips and salsa. 
Now, I don't want anyone to think Sam's is mexcian food...it's not. The whole place is more ""southwest inspired"" as opposed to ""southwest"", or ""Mexican"" or ""authentic"". 
They have décor that looks sort of Fredrick Remington meets Javier Sordo Madaleno...nice, southwest-ish/modern. The chairs in the dining room are, frankly, less than comfortable but they fit the décor, so, OK. Just don't complain to me when they make your butt sore after 20 minutes!
Back to the chips and salsa...I like the flour tortilla chips that Sam's serves, as well as the blue corn and sweet potato chips and the salsa is decent as well...very tomatoey, but spicy and flavorful, but it's not Mexican...not for everybody, but we were happy:)
The actual food portion of our lunch came before we became completely engorged with the chips portion. Everything was very tasty.

The Sedona Spring Rolls have plenty of spice and heat, and are also very nice.

I've done dinner and drinks a few times before, but most recently had happy hour stuff at the bar - with reasonably priced margaritas, and friendly bartenders too.  Decent, but so-so chicken tortilla soup and quesadillas.

Jake is right.  This can be a pretty good date place, when you go with a pretty good date.  My last dinner here was an awful date gone awry, but thankfully the food was the saving grace here (or maybe it was by default).  Let's just say that my date almost got a swift kick in the ass on the way out and my delicious chile-rubbed steak almost got thrown as a weapon Napoleon Dynamite style.  But I digress, back to the dinner.  The steak was cooked as I asked (medium), and had a great marinade with a flavorful spiced rub, but the chile mashed potatoes were OK, and thought it lacked that chile punch that I was hoping for.  While the food quality is OK here, it's just that - average.","0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA",3,"2007-05-15",3,"review",0

I was borrowing my friend's car (Honda Civic) when I accidentally scratched the front bumper. I felt really bad about it so I wanted to pay out of of pocket to fix it. I saw the reviews that Ivey Auto Body Specialist had on Yelp and decided to give it a try.

I brought the car in and meet Doug. Doug was very friendly and professional. He did a fantastic job fixing the scratch on the front bumper of the car. He was both accurate about the cost estimate (not a penny more) and the time estimate (12 noon sharp the next day). Additionally, he also noticed that there was a small dent at the front of the bumper and fixed that too.

Needless to say, I was very pleased with the work that he had done. I'd highly recommend you pay Doug a visit the next time you need to have your car fixed. He definitely knows what he is doing and is very good at it.

When we walked in, I thought that it would be such a fine, impressive place to bring out-of-town, business guests. However, the food and service did not live up to the standards of the atmosphere and the hotel it's attached to. 

We went as a group of about twelve guests for a business lunch today. A few of us ordered the catch of the day, which was the red snapper. However, it was so flavourless and tough that it tasted like the catch of yesterday. The parsnips that came with it were tasty though. Two people ordered the hanger steak, which presented beautifully and looked delicious, but they both said their meat was cold. 
Some of the waitstaff were nice, one seemed very inexperienced and a couple of others seemed snooty and apathetic. One served my salad in front of me, then without asking if  I'd ordered it, took it away and gave it to someone else. I even stopped him to ask him why he was doing that, yet he ignored me and continued on serving it to the other individual. They only offered us coffee and tea after we were almost through dessert.

We are Saturday and It's Montreal en Lumiere. There's a special Brunch Menu for the occasion. My friend Karine heard good things about La Coupole so we decide to give it a try. We make a reservation for 3.

I arrive 10 minutes late, my friends are already at our table. The first floor is completely empty and its 12:40. There around 14  people (approx 5 tables) in the second floor. Our server give us the menu and coffee. 

We get our appetizer after 25 Min. Its a bit long for smoke salmon and oysters.
My oysters are not very cold and only get a piece of lemon and a sour sauce as garnish. Nobody is impress with their plates.

We wait another 40 Min to get our second dish. We all ordered egg Benedict and they are all overcooked. So basically not really an egg Benedict. There's a table spoon of hollandaise sauce and the plate is really sad looking. Finally after more than an hour of service we finally get our first glass of water and toast. If you compared it with eggspectation, im telling you, eggspectation is just Wayyy better and you won't feel rip off.

At this point I don't even want to complain. We had 2 different server and now the manager is serving us. Its really strange because overall we had 4 different server (3 server and 1 manager) doing the service.
The manager took a while before finally taking out finished plates. He made and inappropriate comment to my friend about her not finishing her potatoes that made everybody uncomfortable. 

My friend told me then that when she arrive 15 min early for brunch the manager told her really seriously to wait outside. when she was about to turn around and leave he told her that it was a joke... so you can have a good picture of the brilliant type of manager running that place. 

Finally for our last dish, my friend who is a pastry chef got pastries of course. The cake was sooo dry just trying to take a bite was work. our plates once again looked all very sad. the waiters were all trying hard too look very busy with their now 4 tables. 

We were the 3 of us debating and thinking hard to realize it was all our worst service we ever had. on top of it we all make better food than what we had serve. It was not quality food and we all paid 40$ for that.

They have different colored tags, which on certain days are up to 75 percent off. This is awesome. CHEAP STUFF. You can call and check, or they have a sign with the dates that certain tags are discounted. I just got a whole bunch of Time Life Foods of the World books for a buck fifty each. I like that. Now, on to what I don't like.

I noticed a while back that they hired a new manager for the store. I now know that all of the nice, HARD-working elderly women that staff the store are unpaid volunteers. Meanwhile, the creepy Xtian white guy gets paid to lord it over them- while actually doing little of the real work. I have observed this every time I've been there. Do these women complain? Not to me. They do the work of pricing, organizing, cleaning, ringing folks up and every other thing- and they do it with a smile.

The creepy manager dude? Well...the first thing he did to me (this was about a month ago) was ring me up with my debit card and then proceed to address me by my name which he read off my card. In a very familiar, conversational way.This felt smarmy and boundary-violating. I never introduced myself, and I didn't know his name- although I do now; it's Ken. 

So, what happened on Friday? He hit me. Yes, this creepy dude actually SMACKED me on the arm as I brushed by him while entering the store. I did not body-check him, honest. He then said to me in this petulant voice: ""Are you even paying attention?"" I said: ""Paying attention to what?"" I then realized what his problem was, but didn't have much sympathy since he had just smacked me on the arm like a pathetic 12-year-old dweeb. I asked, ""Is anything broken? Do you think you'll survive?"" I think he got the point. Maybe his mother didn't teach him how to say ""excuse me""?

Hey, creep: it is NOT OK to hit your customers. And, I think it's really wrong to not pay the women who do the vast majority of the work, while you get a salary to ""manage"" them.

So, I'll still stop in for discount stuff now and then, but I will continue to avoid any further direct interaction with the creep who 'manages' this store. Hopefully he won't confront or touch me in any way again- if he does, there will be a BIG problem. God bless!","1_VZR-M44VcvKVrfAyyZAA",2,"2012-04-30",1,"review",0

Honey syrup was different but what really made the pancakes was the whipped cream.  My girlfriend commented on how it was ""just like her grandma made it"".  Always a good sign :)

Can get a little hot in there, as it seems they don't have A/C, just fans and a swamp cooler, and the art on the walls could use some help.  But I love the simplicity and design of the place, and considering I moved just down the street, this will definitely be a regular spot of mine to hit up.

I arrived just past noon with a co worker, luckily there was a police car parked nearby so I was not afraid to leave my car in this less than ideal neighborhood.

 From the outside it looks modern, trendy and bright. 

Inside are white tables and chairs, seating is limited but their business also seemed to be a bit limited. After hearing about the specials and looking over the menu I chose the Blue Cheese Quesadilla with tomato Marmalade as I do love blue cheese. 

When my meal arrived I was shocked how small, pale and pedestrian it looked. Unlike the photo provided my quesadilla was much smaller made with an out of a package soft taco sized tortilla. Accompanying it was a small almost garnish sized dollop of rice salad on top of some baby spinach greens. The rice salad was cold, and flavorless, cold rice is rarely a good culinary choice.

 My quesadilla was under done and unevenly browned, there was plenty of marmalade but not too much cheese. The flavors just did not work for me even when I tried to pair it with the apple garnish. 

My coworker ordered the lentil soup special of the day. It came in a small cup with a challa spinach and cheese Panini on the side. When a ~100lb female says hr portion was small you know it must be small. She enjoyed the soup, and felt the Panini was just mediocre filler. 

My second drink refill, when it finally came was warm as they had no ice in the pitcher.

I see no reason for me to try another meal here.","-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg",1,"2010-02-25",1,"review",1

(For shape, think of the Flatiron Building in New York on a tiny, tiny scale.)  The windows are covered with thin 15-foot mix-and-match drapes tied to reveal Grand and 13th Ave. views.  The vaguely triangular dining room gives way to a door frame through which you find the blackboard menu and register, where you order.

I took two friends on Saturday during Art Detour for a late lunch and the place was about half-full with the owner and one other person working.

There are two daily specials, and I had the Garbanzos and Eggplant in a Coconut Milk Curry, which came with brown rice, baguette pieces, and a side salad of field greens modestly but flavorfully dressed, all for $6.50.  The curry was rich, warm, and filling, and the firmness of the garbanzos went well with the butter-soft eggplant.  A great lunch for the price.

My friend Katie had the messy but delicious tabbouleh and chipotle hummus wrap, and my friend Kelly had a large salad with cranberries, almonds, goat cheese, and manchego.  It was dressed with balsamic vinegar only (no oil?), so the flavor was mostly sweet and tangy.

The drinks, we agreed, were on the subpar side.  The orangeade was inventive and attractive on the menu, but was mostly diluted and unsatisfying for $3.

Sapna's seems to be sorting out the ordering, serving, clean-up system, not to mention operating the register.  Ringing up sales took about 3-5 minutes per patron, and you pay at the end.  The half-eaten and abandoned sandwich at the adjacent table remained for our entire hour lunch.

Nevertheless, I am so grateful for fresh, interesting food on Grand Ave., and I'm confident Sapna Cafe will work out the service issues.

I ordered toast. It took 40 MINUTES to get my damn toast!!! I don't care how ""busy"" any place is, 40 minutes for toast is unacceptable. 
The snarky worker gave me attitude when I asked how much longer it would be.
""Well, we're busy"" was the reply. But when I pay $3.79 for toast with butter and I don't have it 40 minutes later, being ""busy"" isn't the response I want to hear.

Here are my issues. Although the owners/servers are nice, the service can be really really bad. I'm not a pessimist, but why would a waiter only fill up a glass of water halfway?

The red peppers in the quesadilla were actually in marmalade form and tasted fantastic - I'd love to try the bleu cheese and tomato quesadilla. I loved the simplicity of the panini; all of the veggies were cooked just right. The sandwich didn't fall apart, but it was fully stuffed with goodies. And if I could drink the Moroccan mint tea everyday, I'd consider myself the luckiest woman in the world. 

The decor inside is simple and the service was friendly. I love the sprigs of basil as the table flowers. We waited an average amount of time for our meals (approximately fifteen minutes) and the waitress was available when we needed her.

The paninis are priced right - $7 for a nice sandwich with a small side salad of mixed greens. All-in-all, the food gets a solid 4 stars. The service, however, is their weak point.

I loved the building from the get go...had been there before and thought it was brilliant to open a restaurant in that space.  How cute!  Cozy and charming.  Loved it.  

We arrived at 2:30 on a Saturday and we were told to take a seat - and then we waited quite a while for someone to come and take our order.  They never asked us if we wanted water, and the drink I had ordered was not available so we both ordered cold drinks - he had Ginger Lemonaide and I had Orangeaide.  Loved the Ginger flavor, but both the drinks were syrup sweet - which was not what we were hoping for - we like our citrus to have some tang.
Then we ordered a bowl of soup, quesdilla with brie and onion marmalade (both for me) and a turkey sandwich with cheese and mustard sauce (him.)  Both our plates arrived and were very nice...but no soup ever came.  Then we waited, thinking the soup and the silverware was coming, and we waited...and waited...and no soup - and still waiting.  My lovely companion got up and stole some place settings from somewhere else and in doing so we snuck into the kitchen to inquire about my soup.  They said they forgot - which was cool - but apparently they had put it away and it was going to have to be reheated which meant we ended up sharing everything...except the soup.

Now for the food.....it was good - but not great.  It was somewhat bland.  It had great, fresh ingredients, but everything was tainted with something sweet.  The soup needed salt (they don't have any on the table) and the other items were meant to be sweeter - I guess.

So maybe this is a GREAT restaurant and I was just tainted by the slow service.  Or maybe we should have ordered something else.  I promise to go back - I refuse to give up on this place...It's just too damn cute!","-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg",3,"2010-01-20",0,"review",0

Friday night I stopped in for dinner solo - warmly welcomed.  But, sadly, only two other tables were occupied.   Two more came in while I was there.

First of all...service issues listed in prior reviews are mostly true. This is not a ""get 'em in, get 'em out"" kind of place, so we didn't see our waiter that often. I was prepared for a slow experience, so it didn't bother me...much. That said, I do want a cup of coffee more frequently than every 20 minutes. Our server mentioned that a fresh pot was being brewed, so I understood the delay for the first cup.

We both ordered brunch specials. I had the much bally-hooed pumpkin pancakes, which didn't taste all that pumpkin-y. I haven't yet decided if that is good or bad. The cream cheese/walnut topping was awesome and they were not skimpy with it. The pancakes were moist and delish. The leftovers (which didn't really fit into the chinese leftover box I was given) will be wonderful tomorrow a.m., I'm sure!

Hubby had a baked breakfast casserole. It smelled delish and he claims it was wonderful. It had spinach, chorizo, egg, tomato and cheese (and other stuff i'm sure) and was baked. It looked a bit runny, but after mixing it all together and slathering it on top of the home fries (which he claimed were good), it lost its runny appearance. Go figure!

I felt that the room could have used some sound deadening, as the group at the other table was a bit loud, but the front door was open and the street noise was non-existent. Cute atmosphere...all IKEA, all the time!

Our check was exactly $20 without tip/tax, so I felt like it was a successful outing. Great weather, great food, good (if not slow) service.

Been here twice. Second instance first Friday. Met with my precocious sister and a girl with a similar hair style. 

The waitress was charming and fresca like a cilantro roasted lime creme fraiche. As she explained the menu, she remarked on my visage and stated that I appeared unimpressed. Either I am easy to read or she is good at detecting mannerisms.

I ordered the quesadilla with goat cheese and red bell pepper marmalade. It was tasty. However the inner portion of the tortilla was soft and soggy from the cheese yet the ends were crisp and too brittle. All in all the dish was a good combination of flavors and adequately priced for the ingredients.

The coffee was good. That is a huge plus. 

Finally they changed service in between our visit. A bit weird. An introduction would have been nice. They did not offer to refill my coffee nor served us water. Was their a shortage that I was not aware of? 

Anyway, it is spartan and white with copious amount of window space. Not sure if I like it, but it is definitely a style.

We either find something near where we plan to go, something in route, or just plain go out of our way to have some place that has gotten killer reviews. This place is not the third one yet, but was on our way (mostly) to Goodyear. We were headed out for a ball game (of course). 

From the direction we were heading, there was no real perfect exit to get off the 10, so we did a little round a bout thing. But, we got there and found it. Take a good look at the pictures, it helps when you are searching for this place. We got parked with no difficulty and were worried that the place might not even be open. It is pretty desolate around this area. Not too ""scary"" as Matt K's sister thinks, at least not at 10am in the morning.

Lots of white ikea tables and chairs with cute flowers on all of them. Bright drapery covering the sunny side of the building's windows. Lots of natural light in here and very inviting. The staff greeted us right away and asked us to order up at the counter, as they do not have menus printed yet. So, I assume that is coming. 

We walked through the doorway into more of a kitchen area that had a counter setup and a large board with menu items. There are daily lunch specials, about 6-7 breakfast items, a lunch menu and a heafty list of specialty drinks. This place is really a true ""Asian"" Fusion, incompasing all of Asia. But, with a dabble in a few extra places, we will just call this world fusion. There are lots of really creative dishes and things that I would not necessarily have put together. But, they work. 

I ordered a Calcutta Egg wrap. This was really unique. The tortilla and the egg were like one. Inside there were veggies (too many onions for me, I will omit them next time), including carrots, cilantro, and tomato. They give you a side of sweet chili sauce to top it. Other than the onions that I fished most of out, this was DELICIOUS. I am not sure how they did the egg, but I do not have to know. I just have to eat it. SG ordered a scrambled egg plate with stir fried asian veggies. He loved the combination and was surprised to find how great it all was together. 

We both stepped outside our norms and also got a specialty tea. We ordered the Indian Chai. It was very good. There were lots of other choiced that tempted me, but this one struck me first. I would love to go back and try the Ginger Lemonade. I am a sucker for ginger!

Overall, this is a good little place with some really fresh, tasty, creative menu items. I hope that the lunch traffic can sustain them, since they have such potential. COME ON YELPERS, get in there and check it out. It is close enough to stop in for breakfast or lunch and get a little bite, even if you take it out, rather than eating in.","-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg",4,"2009-03-12",3,"review",2

The space is really bright and airy, we went up and ordered at the counter and then slipped outside and moved our table into the sunshine. The man-friend and I split the veggie pasta special, the veggie sandwich, a glass of gazpacho, and each had a glass of ginger lemonade. Our lemonade came out first, and it was good. Not as gingery as I like it, but not surprising. I like a lot of ginger. 

Next out was the gazpacho. The chef (and I think owner?) mentioned that she was from Spain, so I knew I had to give it a try. It was listed under drinks, but I didn't really imagine that it would actually come out in a glass with ice and a straw. I got over the presentation quickly. This was THE BEST gazpacho I've had in years. Totally pureed, garlicky, with breadcrumbs in the mix so it tastes a bit creamy. Basically, the real freakin deal. 

It didn't take long for the rest of our meal to make it out. The pasta was really flavorful, with heaps of veggies piled on top of a hearty serving. The veggie sandwich wasn't a new favorite, but it wasn't bad, either. Both came with mixed greens salads and a vinaigrette. The salad was tender, the dressing was alright. 

We had a bit of a glitch with our bill on the way out. Everything is manually entered into the system, old school style, so take a closer peek at your check. 

There were lots of other tasty looking things on the menu like the Gypsy stew, pear and gorgonzola sandwich and some breakfast items, so we'll definitely be back.","-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg",3,"2009-03-12",1,"review",1

The food tastes as though it were served off your own stove, with grandma at the spoon. It's homey and tasty. I had the chiken potato soup (the daily special $6.50) and it was very tasty, accompanied by 3 toasted baguette slices, served dry for dipping, and a mixed green salad with a fruity vinegarette. The portions were perfect. I ordered the morroccan mint tea with much anticipation, but to my dismay it was not what i had in Morroco or Tunisia. I guess serving a tea glass filled completely to the rim with mint and tea will have to be a home made thing. ( Thinking back to my travels i wonder where they grew all that friggin mint? They had to sell it in bushells with the amounts in each glass.) My nephew ordered the chicken panini and it was delicious, but cost $7 because it comes with a salad.

There was a steady flow of patrons, so the food will rest assured be fresh. Not to many people know about the place which makes getting in and out easy. Best part is this location is directly across the street from ShopDevious.com so you can shop and eat on your lunch break with time to spare. 

On the bad side, i tried to sit outside to enjoy the fresh air, but the street was so unleveled i ended up sitting sideways at the table which was on a downward slope, and my soup seeped over the edge until i could make a dent with the spoon, ending up all over my tray and plate. Next time i'll sit inside. Good thing the food was too good to notice the slope after the first bite (i even picked up my bowl holding it in hand at one point) it was so delicious.","-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg",3,"2009-03-06",2,"review",1

I wonder what that means?
The first thing I noticed was the bright airy space that felt like an oasis coming in from 100 degree mid afternoon weather.
The girl working was totally adorable and sat us down with some menus. She immediately started gushing about the lentil salad, so I didn't get much time to look closely at the menu. I was too worried about hurting her feelings NOT to order the lentil salad, so we settled on that and the eggplant panini sans cheese. 
best.
salad.
ever.
Extremely fresh tasting, local greens, lentils, and other veggies in a barely there lemon vinaigrette.  And some pita on the side.
The panini was okay. Yummy rustic whole wheat bread.
As we munched, I noticed the lush little patch of garden growing by the telephone pole outside. A grip of basil just basking away in DIRECT SUNLIGHT and looking fantastic. WTF I couldn't keep mine alive for a week! 
Anyway.
Total for the sandwich and salad was around $14. Not mad at that.

I've given this place several tries. Every time the service is terrible. They're understaffed (even when we were the only table there... one person working at a restaurant isn't possible), and if there are more than three employees there at once, they always get confused. I'm not sure what the reason is...the place only has like eight tables. 

Second, the atmosphere is depressing. Sapna has a really different setting in the tip of the Bragg's Pie building. If anything, the atmosphere should be the automatic winner. Instead, it's a plain white room with plain white plastic tables. Last time I was in there, the one painting hanging on the wall fell off, hitting a patron in the head. Then it took several minutes for the server to get him some ice. He had a nice ole welt. 

I like the quesadillas here a lot. The food is fresh... just not always tasty. The ratatouille is strong. I have yet to find a really great salad on the menu.","-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg",2,"2009-11-24",4,"review",2

When I got home and opened the bag of take out, my gypsy stew was placed in a 6.0z  to go coffee cup. I was a little put off by that, and then I look down and the garbanzo bean salad was placed in the smallest lil' container I have ever seen. I was upset because I had just paid $13 for this meal and waited 10 minutes for it to arrive to me.

Sapna is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, and I am so fortunate to live just down the street. The owner, Anna, is from Spain and has travelled the world, and she competently reflects her time in Spain, India, Mexico, and elsewhere in her dishes. 

The food is most important, and this is where Sapna shines. A regular at the Downtown Farmers Market -- both as a vendor and a buyer -- Anna's food is local, fresh, organic, and filled with vegan and vegetarian options. Rarely do I order off the menu, as Sapna's specials reflect what just came off the farm. Yes, I have had a dish or two that didn't wow me, but the homemade pasta is some of the best I've ever had, and the paella is right out of Spain (when it is included with the specials).

The space is small, but charming. Shaped like a slice of pie with large windows on both sides of the angles, the spot in the Bragg's Pie Building is fun, casual, and filled with local art for sale. The floors are unfinished, the furniture is from Ikea, and the tables have basil or whatever is currently growing in the outside containers in small vases; and sometimes they are growing roots in the water. High end? No. Quirky? Sure.

The service is friendly, but can be slow if the place gets full. If you want fast and typical, Sapna is not for you. If you like fresh and local from a talentePhoenix owner/chef, put this place on the top of your list!","-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg",4,"2011-01-07",0,"review",0

We were seated relatively fast and our orders were taken in short order, but after that service came to a grinding halt. The menu is limited in general but the sandwiches looked great, of course that was not what I ordered. I went for the $5 gypsy stew which was really tasty, but I was served a portion that should have cost $1.25. I mean seriously, soup is the classic poor people food, this had like 16 garbanzos, a few random veggies floating around in it and a little bit of potato. For $5 I could have made at least a gallon of soup. Please at least serve a portion that isn't blatant about ripping me off. Thank you. Because I'd gone light on dinner I ordered the olive oil cake thing I'd seen at the register with a tag on it that said $2.50 a slice. The cake came out with a side of 4 cantaloupe cubes and 1 strawberry in some glaze. The cake was nice, pretty much the consistency of corn bread and no heavy olive flavor. I'd never had it before so weee, new things in my mouth.  When it came time to pay my $2.50 slice of cake morphed into a $5.50 dessert. Say what? 

I am infinitely annoyed by price gouging and none of this food is spectacularly intricate or worth the wait. When I tell you that we waited 30 minutes for 4 sandwiches and 1 cup of soup I am not speaking in hyperbole. We didn't leave sapna until 10PM because the server forgot to serve me the cake slice i'd ordered at the same time as the soup.

I told her after the first session that the strength isn't hitting the coarser hair so she upped it and went over everything three times. Thanks Jenny!!

The procedure that was suppose to be done was the stomach line ""small area"". Jenny applied a cooling gel over the correct small area but when she ran the laser hair removal machine over my stomach I noticed she was going over my entire stomach!!! Which majority of stomach did not have the cooling agent on it for protection. It stung really bad as she was moving the machine around but it was my first time so I assumed that was a normal feeling. Woke up the next day and the left side of my stomach had multiple 2nd degree burns!!! Went back to show Jenny what her neglect had done and she said ""Omg I've never seen that before. Put Neosporin on it"". That's it. It's been a couple months and I've had to spend hundreds of dollars for prescription creams after meeting with my dermatologist to get this treated. Please save your skin and go somewhere where they are actually experienced in laser hair removal.

Otherwise, they definitely have the ""better"" type of laser that is more effective and less painless.  About 99% of my underarm hair is totally gone. Definitely worth the Groupon, just make sure they get it all.

My only other gripe is their cancellation policy. They confirm with you the day before, but I happened to have an emergency in the interim after I confirmed (my son started throwing up in the middle of the night, so I couldn't make my morning appointment because I had to take him to the doctor). I attempted calling, texting, emailing... everything... to let them know I wouldn't be there and to please reschedule me for later in the day. I didn't get a call until later on that day and they told me I could reschedule, but had to forfeit one of my treatments. I even offered to show them the doctor's note that we were at the appointment, but she said no. I was really bummed and it kind of turned me off to future purchases.

I had never had laser hair removal done before so I didn't know what to expect. My first few experiences were great. I had a good laser tech who was a little too talkative but enjoyable. 

With the first few sessions I noticed quite a difference in the hair growth so I purchased session to get my bikini and legs done. In the middle of my treatments the initial tech I had left and so another tech took me over. I immediately noticed a difference in the way the laser was handled and the number of passes they did over an area. I don't know who trains these ladies on how to use the laser but you'd think it'd be more consistent. I don't know how to use the machine, but their techniques were so different, I imagine ONE OF THEM HAD TO BE DOING IT WRONG. 

I continued with the sessions and because of the results I was seeing didn't bother going anywhere else. As long as I continued with the sessions I saw improvement. As soon as I stopped all of the hair slowly started coming back in full force. 

After my switch to the new employees, no one ever asked what kind of results I was seeing. Was I getting less hair growth? Thinner? How often did I need to shave now? No one ever asked or seemed to care. They seemed to want me in, out, and on to the next person. 

It's been a few months since my last appointment. I did a total of 6 sessions for each my legs, underarms, and bikini. At this point it appears as though ALL OF MY HAIR HAS COME BACK AS THICK AS BEFORE. I understand this isn't completely their fault as everyone reacts differently to laser hair removal, but I was at least hoping to see some improvement.","GRPD0HRi-tLtIU0NHQ6o5g",3,"2016-06-09",0,"review",0

The treatments are very thorough, and they slowly increase the laser heat gradually. I know it is effective because I can sometimes smell my hair burning off when I tell them to up the light power.

I went in for hair on the sides of my face because tweezers left me a lot of ingrown hairs. After the first treatment, I noticed considerable less hair growth after the first week.

I was told I was going to be charged $25 for cancelling day of! I've completely missed my appointment once in January and wasn't told of any fee! They rescheduled me without any problem. All of a sudden they start charging a fee and not telling us? If it had been this way the whole time how did I not know?! Especially since Ive had to reschedule before. I didnt get any sort of warning. 

For someone who has bought more than one package and have been going for 6 months (my treatments are 3 weeks apart, you'd think they'd make an exception and say, ""next time you'll be charged $25"" and note it in my chart. But then I said fine just charge the 25 dollars to my account if having that 25$ fee is more important to you than keeping a repeat customer that has spent nearly $300 (and was going to spend more on maintaience packages). That is when she said ""my mistake, you actually dont get charged, you LOSE A WHOLE LASER SESSION! IM SORRY, MY MISTAKE"" I insisted that i didnt know about this policy, and all she said was ""sorry it's always been this way, sorry we never told you, if you don't come back that's fine."" 

What makes me more upset is that I waited 20 minutes last time for my appointment because the customer before me didn't know if she wanted to add on more services for that day or not. I didn't even complain. Other people walked out, but I was understanding and pleasant the whole time. I'm a customer who is easily pleased, I can understand that things happen and pushes the schedule back -- but I don't understand how you can charge or take away sessions from a repeat, friendly  customer who honestly didn't know of your policy without any warning.

Terrible customer service. Cares way more about making money than customer satisfaction.

*edited to add* just read a few other reviews and it's obvious that customers don't know of this cancellation policy. Do a better job of informing us of your policies! Put it in your text!

I went WAY out of my comfort zone and attended a recent Me the Artist event hosted by a friend where I didn't know anyone else there besides her. There were ten artists in total with Ruby and Danna as facilitators.

Ruby and Danna did a terrific job of walking me through the creation of the art piece in a way that even I -- as a non-artist -- could follow and duplicate successfully. They were quick to offer support and encouragement (in general) and assistance for when I goofed something up and needed a fix. 

Fun, eclectic background music helped to create a relaxed setting conducive to creating and Ruby did a nice job of keeping us on task in order to complete the project in the allotted time without making us feel too rushed.  My fellow artists were also friendly and super supportive.

I now feel inspired to play with art more often, even if my inner artist never evolves beyond grade school talent. It is fun and therapeutic!

I was skeptical at first given I have had very little exposure to the painting process but was soon at ease given the step by step instruction.

The class I attended was the close up of the fish and the instructor was Robert. 

First thing, I love that the location was easy to find and there was ample parking because our class was early on a Sunday. The art studio/gallery is very nicely decorated and it is very roomy. I love the high ceilings and the ceiling fans. Very comfortable! The stools seemed not sturdy enough to hold my weight but I was surprised that the lady who checked us in brought me a regular chair right away, without me having to ask. 

The one thing that would make this place better is the sound. It can get loud with all of the other ""artists"" having their own conversations and the instructor was not wearing a microphone. At times, I felt lost during the instruction because I missed it due to not being able to hear what he was saying. 

The atmosphere wasn't as laid-back/silly/engaging as it has been at other places, but it didn't take away from the experience. 

I really enjoyed my experience and looking through the calendar I see lots of other paintings I want to try. I will definitely be coming back to Me the Artist in the near future!","Au42SOOswePU8ZsIFfrhhQ",4,"2013-12-01",1,"review",0

Materials included are: 16x20 canvas, acrylic paints, brushes, and an apron for each student. You can go on their website and check their event calendar to see what the instructor will teach that day. Each week is a different theme and they show samples of the instructors artwork on the calendars to show you as well. I choose the ""Tree of Love"" theme since I was going with my bf and thought it be a cool experience for our first time. You have to make reservations online or by phone. 

We got there pretty early and was greeted by the instructor and she had us sign in and then told us to pick a place to sit. We were talking to her briefly since we were early and she was so sweet. Once everyone was in we got started and she goes over everything step by step to make it real simple. During the class, she will make sure that everyone is at the same pace and then she will proceed with the next step. Her assistance was out that day so her husband was the assisting for the night and he was taking pictures and helping people out if it was needed. When she announced that I was like awww, that's too cute! Her and her hubby teaching her class together! 

Since this was a BYOB painting class, it really made the class more enjoyable with your significance other or friends. It just makes the activity more exciting since you're a little tipsy. I noticed one lady that came in and she even brought a big huge icebox for her BYOB lol. Now that's SMART, I am going to steal her idea and do that next time so my drinks are cold and ready! =)

Overall, I enjoyed this fun little activity a lot. My bf liked it too and we want to go back. We loved how our painting turned out so we got it framed and now it's hanging in our room.

It's a different world compared to the Tempe campus which is a university campus surrounded by an urban setting, Downtown campus is a university set amidst an urban setting. No, it's nowhere close to New York University in Manhattan but where ASU is situated is that it's centrally located in the Phoenix downtown area next to the Transit Center, and an urban park. Everything is within walking distance, CityScape on Washington is less than 6 minutes walk and the Roosevelt Arts District is north of it and less than 5 minutes away. As a campus, it can be recognized by the School of Journalism building on Central, and the University Center building just south of it. Basically the campus starts at the YMCA building to the west, Journalism building to the north, Arizona Center and University Mercado to the east, and the University Center Building to the south. It encompasses more than 6 blocks. It's a good start for ASU, and it's nice to see the university expanding its presence downtown. I wish the university was in more buildings spread throughout downtown instead of a specific area, I think it will eventually get there with the revitalization of the Jefferson warehouse district south of the sport arena but right now it's a good place to be. :)","3N9r9UcvEUlsEqE_yetmYg",4,"2014-12-01",2,"review",1

All my classes are in the same building, which is a bonus. All is all my professors offices.

I don't feel like I can knock it for it's expensive factor because I already knew that coming into it. But I will knock it a star because of it's food options are limited, perhaps too much so. I have money on my SunCard so I went to Taylor Place one day to score some food. I'm not a resident there so I was majorly peeved by the price of a lunch. It's $7.50 for a one hour time limited all-you-can eat buffet. I'd be happy if I didn't catch it just before dinner hit so I would have had some hot food choices, but no luck. They set the dinner food out and it was about 7 mintues before dinner started (4:30) and they were very concerned about not letting students devour that food until dinner opened.

So my ""lunch"" I was stuck with a $7.50 salad and stale cookie. I won't go back there. I'll stick to City Cafe limited hours and get another chicken ceasar wrap for $5.50 - still a bit pricey but it's basically what I had at Taylor Place wrapped up.

I like the lobby and the success center is a score. The professors are nice and open to concerns (for the most part) and are willing to work with you.","3N9r9UcvEUlsEqE_yetmYg",4,"2010-01-31",2,"review",1

The starbucks in the TP dorms is one of the nicest ones around, and it's not just for college students.

Caravelle is a little Vietnamese joint in Place Ville Marie. I know. ""Caravelle"" doesn't sound Vietnamese, but it is.

Look, it's not Pho Lien, but for a food court, this place is pretty damn good. You can even find some of the more adventurous pho fixings here like tripe and brisket and the soup isn't just ""passable"". It's probably the best pho option in the Golden Square Mile, and very cheap to boot!

This place is very popular at lunch time, so mentally prepare yourself for a long wait in line. The only reason I don't come here more often is that I work right upstairs and prefer to spend my lunch hour avoiding running into my coworkers like the antisocial hermit that I am!

It is located on the outer edge of Place Ville Marie's food court somewhat close to the entrance the Central Station (Gare Centrale). During lunch time there will usually be a line-up at this place, however, the line moves surprisingly very fast.

When I am in the mood for soup at work for lunch, I will normally come here and have one of ""Vietnamese"" soups since I don't have to worry about the weather conditions outside as this place is within PVM and PVM is one of the buildings connected to the ""underground city"". The soups aren't as good as a place like Pho Lien but I find it good nevertheless. Not that it makes any difference to me but this ""Vietnamese"" restaurant is run/managed by Cantonese speaking workers (it might also be owned by them) so you won't get the variety/authenticity of a place like Pho Lien for Vietnamese soup.

The bowl size for the soup is decent. When eating at the food court, they ask you to bring back the bowl after you're finished.

They accept credit cards and debit cards. If paying by card, the cashier will show you the amount on the machine and ask about whether she can use the tap to pay feature. 

I eat here a few times a month especially if I am feeling under the weather or feel a cold coming along.

I rank them 4.5 stars which like all my reviews, I've rounded the 0.5 up since I don't want to shortchange the restaurant.

There was a time that I was completely hooked on afternoon frozen yogurt and going almost daily. The winter weather helped break me of that addiction and now I'm back on what others would consider a ""normal"" schedule. 

I love that the flavors change every day and you can print a calendar from their website showing the schedule of flavors. There are about eight different flavors in any given day, and one of them is a ""No Sugar Added"" flavor. 

The OCD side of me really shines when a new month starts. I print the calendar, take out my highlighter, highlight all of my favorite flavors and those of my fro-yo addicted coworkers, and hang the calendar outside my cube wall. That way it is much easier for us to tell when we need to work time into our schedule to hit the yogurt shop. 

The flavors that are typically highlighted are: 
- Chocolate Covered Banana & Marshmallow (served on the same day, really good as a swirl) 
- Pistachio (really good with almonds as a topping, I tried getting pistachios as a topping and it was a little much) 
- Butterscotch (reminds me of pudding cups back in the day) 
- German Chocolate & Caramel Custard (also served on the same day and very good as a swirl) 
- Irish Cream & Kahlua (not served on the same day, but the closest thing to drinking at work) 
- S'mores (delicious with a graham cracker topping) 
- And every once in a while I like the Reese's with (you know it) Reese's as a topping!!

a few spoonfuls of almond rocca then proceeded to fill the cup with more yogurt and another couple spoons of rocca.

This is unfortunant since the owners are so lovely and their product is decent.

I can't say I like it better than Yogurtland in Tempe (see my review) but it is a good alternative in a pinch.  Like David B. says, they serve Miss Karen's frozen yogurt, so it is not tart like the newer PinkBerry or its clones throughout the US.  Also, you won't be able to have unlimited toppings or serve yourself the yogurt. Not as much fun.  But again, if you are looking for a non-fat alternative to ice cream, this is a great place to stop in.

"3348",6,"PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg","3VXmOWpNm18VSuXww4Vu0Q","Ever since I started working downtown, I vowed to continue my personal tradition of rewarding myself with something yummy and sinful...kinda like a pat on the back for a job well done for the week. In my previous life as a PR bitch in the private sector, I rewarded myself with libations--vodka/tonics with two limes for extra Vitamin C; vodka Collins with three maraschino cherries instead of one; cranberry and vodka because I heard it cleanses out your urinary tract; a dirty martini for those super grueling weeks.

Alas, when I started to work in the public sector, still in PR, I knew I couldn't pull that shit anymore. I had to re-vamp my rewards structure and take out the ""sinful"" from ""yummy and sinful."" That's when I discovered fro-yo...that's frozen yogurt to you all.

My co-worker took me out for coffee one day and quickly mentioned that there is a locally owned frozen yogurt shop on Washington and First Streets. She said they give hefty portions, so I thought to myself that this might just be a good replacement for my vodka concoctions.

The place is called A Touch of Yogurt, and their fro-yo is yummy to the tummy. They are pretty generous with their servings, and the toppings you choose to include in your fro-yo. And then when I did some diggin' about fro-yos, I found out fro-yo can: 1. Help to overcome lactose intolerance; 2. aid digestion of milk protein: 3. help prevent and combat digestive tract infections. Okay...fro-yo had me at ""overcome lactose intolerance..."" that's all I'm going to say about that! They change their menu of flavors...you know, to mix it up a little...keeps you guessing. But no matter what flavors they have available, I am sure that you will find one so satisfying. 

So Fridays, I've officially declared Yvette's Fro-Yo Fridays. I order my ""small,"" sit on one of the outdoor tables, and stare at politicians, lawyers, bums, construction workers, delivery people, while enjoying a mouth-watering serving of fro-yo. 

Hey feel free to join me every Friday for FRO-YO Fridays around 12:30-ish. Oh but not this Friday I'm in San Francisco. So just for this week...FRO-YO THURSDAY!

Anyway...I give it 4 stars...because, let's face it...it might be yummy, but it still ain't ice cream!","6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw",4,"2007-09-25",4,"review",9

I thought it was ridiculous that my wife would be boxing a heavy bag but whatever. She ended up going for about 3 weeks and already lost a couple pounds and was putting up quite a bit! So she dragged me into their club and I admit that I begrudgingly went.   My workouts at the YMCA were just fine i thought.  Crap was I wrong.   I was lucky enough to meet the owner, Casey, on site.  Man is he a motivated fellow. 

You have to buy wraps (they are needed, trust me) for $8.  I ended up owning about 5 pair now!  I used the borrow gloves; and have my own pair now. (On the second pair as we speak).  The first workout nearly killed me in the just the warmup.  I was literally dripping sweat.  I had no idea how to box but the instructor took the time to show me the jabs, crosses, hooks...took me a while to get up to speed.  You were allowed to modify as needed.  I broke my ankle years ago and built up scar tissue and pain prohibited me from doing much of anything.  I've since broken through all that scar tissue and can sprawl, mountain climb, and jump rope like a champ.  The owner, Casey, personally motivates his members and seems to know all of them by name. 

I've gone many times, and visited clubs in different cities, and I go as often as I can...5-6 times per week.  I have my favorite instructors and enjoy the interaction and time with them.  My wife was lost dress sizes and pounds and we've brought many friends with us to this club.  Personally I've lost pants size, pounds, and gained shoulders and chest muscles and abs; finally.  It's a great time, great workout and well worth my time.

This club is ALWAYS clean, smells nice, lots of stock, and a low turnover of trainers.  This place has become a second home to me while the YMCA has remained a distant memory.  Give it a try, first shot is free.  This is premium club; not a gym.  1000 calories does not leave you easily, but they manage to get it out of you.   It's not cheap but considering the alternative, it's the same cost as going out to dinner twice a month, except you end up a healthier person in the end.","3F3YM5wMr3-ieHKhxUemag",5,"2016-08-18",1,"review",0

And yet, the strict journalistic integrity demanded by Yelp requires that I must be honest with myself and with you, dear reader. Kayla's is not worth the 100 foot journey. 

I've given them several chances, and not once have I been anywhere approaching impressed. Thrice I've gone for breakfast and their home fries are consistently dry and tasteless. Even worse, the potato pancakes are, I suspect, mashed potatoes mixed with actual pancake batter. There is not enough ketchup in the world. 

I went once for lunch as I could not in good conscience condemn them having only been there for breakfast. I ordered a tuna sandwich. They were out of tuna. I ordered something else. They were out of that. The next attempt? Out of that too. Now in Kayla's defense, the server explained to me that they had just donated a bunch of food to workers at a local non-profit. Alright, I can get behind that, no hard feelings. But the lunch I did end up with was lackluster.

If you go for lunch, don't expect anything better than you'd get at any standard diner. But a diner that's bad at breakfast? That cannot possibly merit more than 2 stars.","-N94ldMGlQw_SHdfm2pi_A",2,"2012-01-24",2,"review",1

Overall the quality of the food was excellent. We went on a weekend lunch when it wasn't so busy, so the staff were very quick and served us right away.
We ordered a soondobu, jap chae, and this fried fish dish. The soondobu was very hot, lots of ingredients, fresh, and spicy. Comparable to many other Korean restaurants I have been too. The Jap Chae wasn't overly oil and had lots of flavour. The fried fish, which I never remember the name is a staple of this place, I never tried it anywhere else (probably because I never see it on other restaurants menus), but if you love fish, this is something you should try. I've asked the owners there before about the dish and they told me it was a specialty dish and you usually can't find it in other Korean restaurants. A fair warning though, this fish does have bones and is not a fillet but some of the bones can be chewed through. 
The only thing about this place is the korean videos that seem to loop weeks on end. But then again, a lot of these family owned Korean restaurants share the same videos. I wonder if they are hooked up to 1 central server to Airplay these videos.

I am a fan and would definitely return! As far as Korean food goes, they had all the standard offerings of pork bone soup, kalbi, etc. and the much-anticipated and loved accompaniment of side dishes! the side dishes were good but of standard fair! the dishes that we tried (beef stir fry placed in lettuce wraps, deep fried sweet and spicy chicken, and chicken ribs and cabbage) were - for the most part - delicious and of heafy proportions! 

i quite enjoyed what we ordered - the chicken ribs (which translated means dark meat) and cabbage! a melange of cabbage, half cooked chicken morsels, sweet potato and onions (?) are served in a big flat pan over a portable gas burner - so it required a little bit of eater participation! they get the process going by turning on the burner and giving it a little stir, then they intermittently come back to stir it around and scrap the bottom of the pan where the sauce and meat/veg caramelize. what you're left with is a hot bowl of goodness that hits all the notes of sweet, spicy and savoury. we actually figured out what to order by covertly staring at (and eventually asking) the family beside us what they were eating. the aroma, the hot sizzling sounds and the overall appearance of what was going on at their table led us to overcome our chinese politeness to ask. 

the other dish that resonated with me was the deep fried sweet and spicy chicken. our dining mates had it and at our next visit, *i* too will have it! it was delicious! maybe because i haven't had korean chicken in a while or possibly because it was simultaneously crispy + saucy, spicy + sweet (a favored flavour combo of mine), and light + toothsome. i don't know how this dish could possess so many opposing qualities but it did. i think it was battered in rice flour? or just something other than your regular cornstarch because it was a little ""stickier"" in texture - which i liked - so after your initial crunch down into the crispy exterior, your teeth meet a little resistance from the sticky-ish batter that hugs the meat and then through the tender chicken. i'm biased to sweet + spicy, so the sauce got me at first bite. i have to say, my ""can i try a piece?"" turned into more like 5+ pieces ... and to my shame, not of the small and dainty variety. oh and value wise, this dish was huge ... enough for dinner + lunch the next day (for 2 people).

both dishes came with the colourful purple rice - BIG PLUS in my books! 

the only mediocre dish was the beef stir fry - and not worth really writing about.

I will say that when I called wondering where my food was, the guy said he upgraded my 12"" pizza to a 16"" pizza at no extra charge. It really was 4 additional inches of disappointment.","BJeHWkccQRXZKKyBcauenA",1,"2015-07-24",0,"review",0

Why you may ask?
Simple.
1. The staff is friendly and are Japanese.  This is not your typical cheap Chinese or Korean owned Japanese restaurant where you get sketchy sushi. The service is fast, but if you wait more than a couple of minutes for your order to come they apoplogise and offer you tea (hot tea for winter and cold tea in the summer). The staff here understand how to make the diner feel welcome and number one. 
2. The fish is fresh.  There is no second guessing when it comes to their food. One of my favourites is the spicy tuna roll which is actually spicy.  We usually order a 20 piece boat which is delicious. 
3. The price is reasonable considering that you are paying for quality and an authentic experience.

I was waiting for my friend to show up at Cobra Nightclub; already three things I don't like.  King Street West, Nightclubs (especially Cobra), and waiting.
I thought I'd pop in for a quick and inexpensive bite so that I would have energy for the debauchery which proceeded me this evening.

The restaurant is narrow, and it has five or six tables.  On the walls hung original painting which were also for sale.  Super quiet, it was only myself, and another table occupying the space.  There was light dinner jazz in the background which I would therapeutic.  
Real Japanese people here btw.

I ordered a few dishes, and then my eye landed on the one thing I couldn't possibly refuse.  Foie gras sushi!  What on Earth?!  I MUST TRY IT!

I absolutely hate it when I am sat next to a couple who are in the interviewing phase of their date.  Talking about their goals in life, what they expect from a relationship in all aspects.  I tried to drown out the next table's conversation, but the jazz was too soft in this completely quiet restaurant.
I wanted to kill myself...I'm pretty sure I made a facebook status update about how much the next table made me want to kill myself.

The food came at a reasonable paste, and finally when the foie gras arrived..I stared at it drooling.  The piece of foie gras was definitely generous considering the size of the rice roll.  I picked it up with my chop stick, and slowly watched it enter my mouth.  As soon as it touched my tongue, the flavours exploded into a million colourful balloons of butterfly happiness.  And for the duration of my chewing, I completely forgot that a single piece of this sushi cost me $7.00.  
The other sushi were good, fresh, but hard to recall because umm....foie gras!

A light snack, the bill came out to be $60.

Take out sushi is often a risky little game, but not with Toshi Sushi, all of their roles held up beautifully! Granted, they were all veggie, but still: rice remained sticky, rolls remained firm and seaweed kept that nice little crunch. 

Beyond the above experience, I recently popped in for a little lunch. Freshest ebi and spicy tuna I'd had in a while, and if you're in the area and you have a hankering for some fresh Japanese, this place won't disappoint.

If you want another lunch special but it was on another day, you just have to pay an extra $1 for it. Dinner prices are bit more expensive if you're not looking to spend more. In those cases, you are paying for quality vs quantity. At the end of the day, I would rather cough up another $2 for better food. 

There Sashimi quality is always a hit! They always guarantee freshness. I usually go for their chirashi or sashimi dishes when I have time to have a nice lunch. I've also had their bento box specials and the serving portion is the same as any other Japanese restaurant in the city. Although I have to say their teriyaki is worth trying if you want cooked food.

I was there on what should be a busy dinner hour, but the restaurant was empty which is not really a good sign.

I ordered the Unagi Donburi (BBQ eel on a rice bowl). The food came reasonably fast. The eel was rather dry and didn't have enough of that delicious teriyaki eel sauce to mix with your rice (it barely covered all of the eel). What made it worse is the dusting of lemongrass powder which at first made for a nice and unexpectant flavour, but was too overpowering and overbearing.
The dish wasn't bad, but it wasn't good especially at this price.

For Japanese take out I would consider going to Bento Sushi just two doors away, which is more reasonably price and more suited for take out.

While waiting for my take out, I noticed that the atmosphere is very nice. Not trendy or pretensious, just a simple and comfy traditional Japanese restaurant, well sheltered from the traffic of King Street. So I could imagine having a nice dinner there.

Fish wasn't particularly fresh, either. I expect better for $30 and can get better at places like Japango, Sushi Couture and Wow Sushi, Japango being my favourite of these three.

What really bothered me was bits of chopped up pickled ginger nestled between the sushi rice and the sashimi. Likely not a problem for most, but it was for me. I hate pickled ginger and it made for painstakingly slow and not so enjoyable eating.","DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA",2,"2015-06-05",0,"review",0

So what's the difference between your typical all-you-can-eat Chinese sushi joint and this place? Everything. The chef, the staff, the rice, the cuts, and the soy sauce.

The rice is cooked properly. They use the right kind of rice. They season it with rice wine vinegar, sugar and salt. That right there is a considerable difference from the all-you-can-eat 'sushi restaurants' where they can't even get the rice right.

Here's what I can tell you:
1) This is the closest thing to Japanese sushi you'll get in Toronto at a relatively reasonable price.  REASONABLE PRICE - that's the catch phrase here.
2) Some who do not know quality Sushi may complain it's too expensive, but that's because they are comparing this place to Chinese run joints like Sushi on Queen, Sushi Time, etc.  This place has a Japanese sushi chef so to view this place with proper perspective, compare it to other joints that have Japanese sushi chefs.  Consider the costs at Hiro, Ematei and Nami.  All of a sudden the price isn't that unreasonable.
3) When I give this place a 5 star rating, I do so considering the PRICE.  
4) Do not ever order anything from the kitchen without consulting various review sites.  The kitchen chef is not talented in any way.  You come here for sushi and/or sashimi.  That's it.  

What I usually get is the 20 piece sushi party plate @ $28.

When Susur was working at his restaurant, long ago, he was often seen eating here.  The place is authentic.

If you're sick and tired of Chinese or Korean run sushi restaurants that think they can make decent Sushi just because the guy behind the bar happens to be Asian and has a big knife, check this place out and do a taste test.

Apparantly this place is famed for its sweets, including sorbets and banana fitters, but it was their savoury dishes which I was seriously impressed with.  I went for the chef's recommended green beef curry for my main and the sticky ribs for a starter.  The ribs were grilled to perfection and soaked in honey which made them really nice and sweet.  The beef in the curry was tender and had virtually no fat, whilst the sauce was creamy, spicy and full of flavour.  
The food seemed to take no time to be prepared and the staff were proper friendly.  I'd come here again any day and, although it's pretty pricey, it's well worth the money.","6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ",5,"2010-07-01",1,"review",1
"3423",0,"Ga9DnmdmhE0Zzs_jRtmrfA","vVdihXz59_CB5_6eTmVdmQ","Celadon is one of the best Thai restaurants around in Edinburgh. If you ignore the drab exterior and interior, the food is excellent. I first came here with my parent after it being recommended to me by a friend, assuring me it was the best Thai restaurant in Edinburgh by miles, and whilst not quite that good (that honour goes to Thai Orchid), it is definitely up there. The staff are quiet but pretty friendly, and are efficient without being overbearing. 

The food is great, if a bit expensive. They do set menus for those watching their wallets but I always find the dishes available quite restrictive, so we went for the a la carte. The mixed starter is like most Thai places, with the standard spare ribs, spring rolls, fishcakes etc but they were all cooked exceptionally. For a main course I had Tiger prawns with asparagus, garlic and soy sauce, which was beautifully flavoured. The other dishes were all good but their seafood is definitely the speciality. The only problem is that it is expensive, the seafood dishes averaging about £13, not including rice. If your budget stretches to this (probably not if you are a student) then it is a great place to go to, but if not then there are similar places to go to for better value.","6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ",4,"2010-08-03",0,"review",0

However friends that have been more adventurous with their choices also say that the food here is great. The lovely wooden tables and candlelight create a warm atmosphere, and the staff are always friendly and helpful.

"3427",2,"HvQ576LJm6i6QZuTwl7WVg","ev_-x0q1wztR1Lus9ozIHA","Seeing so many Thai restaurants with a mixture of extremely positive and negative reviews, I was a little anxious about booking anywhere. I am a student with a limited budget, so eating out is an occasion (here a reward for having finished all my assignments), and the Thai restaurant I chose had to be a very good one.

I looked at about 5 other places in town. Some were too expensive, some didn't offer enough in the way of veggie food, others were just too far away. I was considering a takeaway, when I suddenly noticed for the first time ever the Celadon which is just across the road from me. I can literally just cross the road and I'm on the doorstep. The next task was to check it was okay online. Yelp and other sites all pointed in the same direction: ""top notch"" and ""entirely faultless"" service, delicious authentic food and good value. Being so close, I had to check it out.

The menu is deceptive. It doesn't look very vegetarian, but it turns out they are willing to vegetarianize just about everything on the menu, are conscious about dietary problems and don't use shrimp paste! Yay!

I booked for 7.30 today. Before 8pm from Monday-Thursday there is a pre-theatre menu, where you get a starter and a main for £12.99. Upon entering we noticed  that the place was pretty empty, there was just one other couple eating. We put this down to the out of the way location, but after half an hour it suddenly filled up! The interior is minimalist and tastefully decorated, nothing too intrusive. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. 

My boyfriend ordered from the pre-theatre menu: spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce, pad thai with tofu. I ordered a green curry with tofu and thai sticky rice. My boyfriend Robbie thought his starter was a bit small, but very much enjoyed it and his main made up for the small starter size. His pad thai came with the peanuts and various spices on the side (to sprinkle over the noodles), and a small salad. He said it was delicious, but after tasting some of mine he looked jealously at my dish every so often. Mine was super spicy, with plenty of red chillies in the sauce, fragrant herbs and spices, big chunks of fried tofu and plenty of fresh crunchy vegetables. My rice came in a bamboo bag which was used to steam it. The portion size was massive, but it was so good that I ate more or less everything. 

Thai puddings are amongst my favourites. Robbie opted for the banana fritter with coconut ice cream, whilst I went for the banana cooked in sweet coconut milk. Strangely enough, this is a quite nostalgic dish for me as I used to eat it a lot when I went out for dinner with my grandparents. It is relatively healthy in comparison to other dessert options, and really rather delicious. The presentation of both pudding was really beautiful, and Robbie wolfed his pudding down despite having declared he was stuffed a few seconds before. He added that it was the best part of the meal... 

For £30 for two without drinks, it wasn't that expensive. I am not sure why Thai is always pricier than other places, but Celadon is cheaper than most but definitely superior to most. Fresh ingredients are well cooked, service is, as Emily H stated, ""flawless"". I would definitely come back here to sample some of the other dishes on offer.","6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ",5,"2013-04-04",5,"review",1

The service was amazing- absolutely top notch and entirely faultless.

The food... wow.  We opted for the sharing platter to start which was amazing.  The tempura was perfect - light, crunchy and not greasy.  The ribs were the star, though, loaded with meat and SO GOOD.  

I had the shrimp pad thai as my main which was loaded with shrimp and had two massive shrimp butterflied on the side which were absolutely fantastic.  The Man had a duck dish which he loved.  I was too busy eating my own food to pay attention to his.  

Our wine - a Californian Zinfandel- was also fantastic and at £15.95, a steal compared to restaurants we've visited lately.

The décor is elegant and the ambiance quiet and intimate. The chefs use only fresh ingredients (no pre-frozen nastiness) and there is no MSG in their dishes. The difference is obvious from the first bite of tender massman lamb, Bangkok beef, or succulent 5-spices duck, or generous Pad Thai. Honestly, after all my visits, I have never tasted anything that wasn't superb.


 Also, as a displaced American foodie, I have been missing the level of service we Yanks prefer. Celedon employs (or is she the owner's wife? Hmm) the best server I have encountered in my time in the UK. Ki (I think that's how she spells it) not only is graceful, charming, and efficient, but she remembers customers' food preferences, even if it's been months between visits. If I could employ 10 Ki clones in our bar/restaurant back home, I would be a millionaire.","6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ",5,"2007-11-03",0,"review",0

The decor the the Celadon is a bit plain and boring but the quality of the food more than makes up for that. 
it is a bit on the pricey side however, with the King prawn green curry costing around £11. I would suggest that the best time to come in would be for lunch where you can get a 2 meal set menu for around £13.","6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ",4,"2010-07-23",0,"review",0

"3454",0,"Om5QDTDyRIV8l4_ZdDopDA","Sr9_XJACvFCFJd-s_jpPwg","Am Finalsonntag verschlug es mich mit befreundeten Paar ins ""Brauhaus zum Schwanen"" nach Esslingen. Die beiden Einheimischen schlugen den Schwanen vor, weil es Esslingens einzige (Haus-)Brauerei darstellt. Die Hausbrauerei liegt mitten in Esslingens Altstadt an sehr ruhigem Platz, bei schönem Wetter kann man davor Platz nehmen. 
Innen war ich allerdings etwas enttäuscht. Von außen dachte ich, man betritt uriges gemütliches Brauereilokal - aber wer hat hier in den 70er oder 80er renoviert und ausgestattet? Schäußlicher und ungemütlicher Fliesenboden, Kunstlederbezogene billige Möbel - geht null. Derweil wären die Grundlagen da: massive Holzdecke, Riesenbalken sichtbar, Ausstattung erinnert zwar an engl. Club und nicht an Brauhaus, ging aber. Würde als Sofortlösung für den erhöhen Seitenraum vorschlagen, 2 große rötliche Teppiche auf Fliesen zu legen und Tische weiß einzudecken, dann sieht man weniger vom Boden und nix von den hässlichen Tischen mehr. Und auf Werbebierdeckel von Germanwings sollte auch verzichtet werden - schaut schäbig aus. Wie die Lage mit den Toiletten zu retten ist: keine Ahnung. Ich musste erst paar Stufen runter zum Tresen, dann Wendeltreppe runter, durch modrig riechenden Barraum durch, paar Treppenstufen hoch, wieder durch weiteren Kellernebenraum, paar Stufen runter und dann war ich da. Erfreulicherweise tiptop neu gemachte, saubere WC-Anlage. Aber beim Weg zurück (s.o.) verfliegt der Eindruck dann leider. 
Die Karte war sehr angenehm gehalten. Übersichtlich, klein und ergänzt durch Tages/Wochenkarte auf Schiefertafeln. Preislich eher für das Ambiente und den Service zu ambitioniert, aber Touris werden ja keine Stammgäste. Ich wählte:
- Schwanen Märzen (0,3 für 3,20€) und später, will ja probieren
- Schwanen Pilsener (0,3 für 3,20)
- Geeiste sommerliche Tomatensuppe (4€)
(Stand auf Tafel vor Gasthaus, beim Bestellen war sie aus, beim Verlassen des Lokals stand sie immernoch draußen..). Folglich umdisponiert:
- Maultaschensuppe (4,50)
- Spinat-Kokos-Suppe (ca. 5,00€ - beide Begleiter)
- Zarter Kalbstafelspitz im eigenen Sud, Gemüsestreifen, frischer Kren und Kartoffeln (14,80€)
- Kalbsfetzen Orientalisch mit Sucuk, Kichererbsen, Zwiebeln, Kartoffeln (18,80€ - Begleitung). 
Die Biere waren beide ok - aber recht charakterlos für kleine (Haus)brauerei. Meine Suppe schmeckte sehr gut. Die Maultaschen waren hervorragend und reichhaltig, die Brühe selbstgemacht. Die Spinat-Kokossuppe schmeckte nur nach Spinat, fand ich eher enttäuschend - optisch aber sehr ansprechend.
Der Tafelspitz wurde in drei extra Teilen serviert: Fleisch im Sud, Kren, Kartoffeln. Alles für sich gut, aber blöd zu essen. Soll man Kartoffeln trocken essen oder in Sud tauchen? Hm, aber das Fleisch superzart, geschmacklich gut gelungen und der Sud merklich selbst und mit Liebe gemacht. Hätte aber alles auf Teller serviert und statt Kren eher Apfelmeerrettich zu Kartoffeln und Fleisch gereicht. 
Bedient wurden wir mehrheitlich von junger, sehr junger Bedienung. Sie bemühte sich redlich, war aber limitiert in ihren Fähigkeiten, sich einfachste Dinge zu merken (Wer bekommt die Maultaschensuppe? Wer den Tafelspitz? Wer das kleine Bier? Wie zahlt man getrennt? ;-) Aber das wird vielleicht noch - schätze Lehrmädel oder Tochter des Hauses. In ihrer Art war sie auch freundlich und Wartezeiten waren völlig angemessen. 
Fazit: Schön gelegenes Gasthaus mit vernünftigem Essen (3,5 Sterne). Innen gehört was gemacht, da fühlte ich mich nicht wohl.","12aWzuzF3YjTpWeB2EOLAA",3,"2014-07-15",0,"review",0

Das Ambiente hat etwas von - wie soll ich sagen - ähm - vielleicht 'Gehobener Landgasthof'? Jedenfalls nicht kuschelig und heimelig - aber auch nicht ungemütlich. Nicht real rustikal sondern eher aufwändig aufgemöbelt. Hat viele Sitzplätze und ist durch die Aufteilung eindeutig 'gruppengeeignet'.

Das Brauhaus zum Schwanen? Immernoch ein Geheimtipp!
Wir waren (wieder mal) spontan und unanagemeldet in einem der besten esslinger Restaurants. Nach einer kurzen Wartezeit am sehr gemütlichen Tresen, wo wir schon mal unser hevorragendes Bockbier trinken konnten, bekamen wir einen wie immer angenehmen Tisch für zwei. Mit das Schöne am Schwanen ist, dass die Tische nicht wie in den meinsten anderen Restaurants auf ""Hautkontakt zu anderen Tischen"" gestellt sind, sondern genügend Platz dazwischen gelassen wurde, dass man weder gestört wird noch sich in der weite verlassen fühlt.
Als Vorspeise nahmen wir einen frischen,knackigen, liebevoll angemachten Salat, der weder in der hausgemachten Tunke ersäuft war noch sich nach mehr Dressing sehnte und eine leckere Flädlesuppe wie von Muttern.
Als Hauptgang hatten wir Rindezunge im eigenen Sud von der Tageskarte. Die Zunge zerging auf der Zunge, kam im Suppenteller schön angerichtet mit frischem, auf den Punkt gekochtem Gemüse und hervorragenden KArtoffeln. Ebenfalls von der Tageskarte, die immer herrlich ausgeglichen und einfallsreich gestaltet ist, kam der Zander auf Blumenkohlpürree, das samtig und leicht mit dem Fisch harmonierte.

Die Küche war wie immer hervorragend, die Zutaten frisch und lecker zu bereitet, mit Liebe angerichtet und durch einen spitzenmäßigen Service kredenzt.
Der Service im Schwanen ist wie immer nicht nur freundlich, sondern auch zuvorkommend. Sollte man Lust auf andere oder weitere Beilagen haben, bekommt man immer einen passenden und durchdachten Rat. Immer ist der Service sehr persönlich, geistreich und herzlich!

Die Einrichtung wirkt keinesfalls ""billig"" wie hier von einem Vorkritiker beschrieben. Sicherlich ist die Einrichtung individuell, weil kreativ und nicht durchschnittlich. Die Massivholztische sind stabil und durchaus für ein ""Brauhaus"" passend. Die Sitzgelegenheiten sind gemütlich. Das Design der beiden Gasträume ist grundlegend unterschiedlich, was eine Bereicherung bedeutet. Wir fühlen uns hier sehr wohl.

Durch die Anordnung der Tische ist trotz des offenen Raumes immer eine gewisse Intimität gewahrt. man hat eben so viel Abstand, dass man seine Ruhe hat, aber nicht soviel dass man sich verloren fühlt. Durch den zentralen, runden Abgang zum Kellergeschoss hat man eine schöne, für den Einrichter nicht unkomplizierte Raumaufteilung, die aber perfekt gelöst wurde.
Im Eingangsbereich präsentieren schöne stilvolle Schränkchen die Spezialitäten, durch die der Schwanen besonders glänzt. Stehtischchen machen das Warten auf einen freien Tisch bei großem Andrang und fehlender vorheriger Reservierung angenehm. Auch hier wird man vom Service nicht einfach abgestellt, sondern betreut und gut versorgt.

Tatsächlich ist die Toilettensituation nicht so ganz beglückend. Das sind aber nun mal die baulichen Gegebenheiten. Aber auch hier glänzt das Brauhaus mit sauberen, durchdachten und neuen sanitären Anlagen. Nach einem ordentlichen Essen schadet ein kleiner Gang durch die Katakomben ja nun auch nicht...

Insgesamt fühlen wir uns im Brauhaus zum Lamm immer sehr wohl, essen spitzenmäßig und trinken ebenso gut.

Durch die zentrale Lage ist Parken in der Nähe kaum möglich. Die umliegenden Parkhäuser sind nicht weit entfernt. 
Aufgrund der guten Erfahrungen einer Weihnachtsfeier vor ein paar Jahren haben wir dort wieder reservieren lassen. Leider konnte sich der gute Eindruck nicht wiederholen. 
Der Service hatte das ein oder andere Essen komplett vergessen und lieferte mit großer Zeitverzögerung die bestellte Ente nach. Leider war diese nur halb gar. Die Schnitzel waren eher mittelmässig. Nur die Gäste, die den Rostbraten bestellt hatten, waren zufrieden.

Das Ambiente innen passt sich dem an: Eher dunkel gehalten, leider mit einem Kachelboden, so dass die Lautstärke nicht geschluckt, sondern eher hallend verbreitet wird.
Neben der Speisenkarte, die in der Standardversion auch auf der Website zu finden ist, gibt es die aktuellen Angebote, die auf Schiefertafeln präsentiert sind. Die Auswahl kann man wohl mit ""gutbürgerlich"" umschreiben, fleischlastig zu Normalpreisen, oft auch als kleinere Portion angeboten.
Wir wählten als Vorspeise ein Urzitronen-Carpaccio (8,50 €): Diese Zitrone hat bei weitem nicht die gewohnte Säure, sondern kann samt Schale gegessen werden, wobei letztere den Großteil der Frucht ausmacht. Wäre sie hauchdünn geschnitten gewesen, wäre sie auch angenehmer zu essen gewesen, so war doch etwas kauen angesagt. Der Geschmack war bestens kombiniert mit Rucola, etwas Nüssen und Tomaten, also eine geschmacklich vortreffliche Idee. Die Kalbszunge (11,80 €) wurde in einem Suppenteller mit einem leichten Sud serviert. Die Zunge herrlich zart, dazu noch etwas Gemüse und Salzkartoffeln. Originell auch dieses in der Präsentation und gut. Wuchtig waren das Kalbshaxenfleisch (14,80 €) mit einer deftigen Sauce, Ratatouille und Rösti. Gut aufeinander abgestimmt und intensiv!
Die Mandeltorte (6,50 €) war zwar warm, leider auch schon etwas trocken, was durch das gute Eis auch nicht ""geheilt"" werden konnte.
Das hausgebraute Pilsener (0,5l für 4,20 €) kommt gut gekühlt und leicht trüb, könnte bei mir auch als spezifische Weizensorte durchgehen. Ein einfacher, aber ordentlicher Cuvée aus dem Umland liegt bei günstigen 20,00 €. Mir bekannte Winzer konnte ich auf der Weinkarte nicht finden, aber wir sind ja auch in einem Brauhaus.
Beim Service hat die Chefin alles im Griff: Sie ist aufmerksam und kann zu allen Fragen klare und freundliche Antworten geben. Dies traf bei unserem Kellner nicht immer zu.
In Summe eine bodenständige Wirtschaft mit guten Speisenangeboten, schön die kulinarischen Wagnisse wie etwa die Urzitronen-Vorspeise.","12aWzuzF3YjTpWeB2EOLAA",4,"2014-06-02",0,"review",0

During the summer months it is not uncommon to find events like free concerts, ice cream socials, and even weddings taking place.  Particulary at the Italian Gardens, and their beutifully recreated piazza.

The store appeared to be Harris Teeter's slightly smaller neighborhood type store and had everything that I shop for including aforementioned mashed taters.   Every employee that I encountered was friendly and I made note to check and see if they offered online ordering at this store.  SCORE - online shopping is available here - hooray!!!

I placed my order online Friday night for an 11:30 am pickup ($4.95 for them to do all of my shopping for me so I can avoid rudeness and poor manners from shoppers?  Yes, please!).  My home shopper called around 10:00 am Saturday morning  to let me know I had a ""clean shop"" (they had EVERYTHING on my very long list) and I could come and pick up my order early. I pulled into the designated pickup spot and let them know I was there and then ran in to leave my plastic bags to be recycled - my first friendly HT face was an older gentleman who let me know that I could just leave the plastic bags on top of the dropbox as it was full (he was so cute, I wanted to smooch him!).  Back in the vehicle I waited only a short time before two more friendly HT employees were out with my order.  I thought the young lady's voice on the phone sounded familiar and when I went to get my groceries, she had been a fabulous home shopper with Stonecrest that had helped me before.  The pickup was quick and effortless, with VERY friendly employees helping me out.  

Harris Teeter customer service has always been excellent in the many years that I have shopped several locations.  A smiling face and pleasant disposition goes a LONG way in dictating where I spend my money and when paired with the convenience of online shopping, I am loyal to the Teeter for all of my shopping.

As the posters have said, their items get sold out quickly however I was still able to make up a half dozen with one each of all that remained.  I believe it was the owner manning the counter and he is a very nice individual.

The doughnuts were very good.  Each type was enjoyable and to us we enjoyed each type similarly.  I am a huge craft beer fan and appreciated the use of beer in each doughnut.

The reason for the 3 star rating - to me it was the price.  We read the posters comments so we knew what we would be paying and we were fine with it.  When we tried each doughnut, we personally could not justify the price of $16 for 6 (or $2.67 each).  In the end, they are still doughnuts and it's very easy to finish one in a few bites and seek out a second one.  It seems a going rate at the top notch doughnut shops is around $1 per doughnut.  Paying 3x that (or $3 each) seems excessive.

Your mileage may vary and I strongly encourage you to check this place out.  The product is good, there is no doubt about that.  Will I go there again?  Yes, maybe once a year type place.","50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA",3,"2014-12-13",1,"review",0

Every Brewnut is evenly spread with it's ingredients to perfection. Some have poppy seeds, some bacon, pork reins, and so on and so forth. AND, they taste amazing. Like, really amazing.

If there's one thing that Clevelanders know, that is beer. And not just your run-of-the mill bud light. I am talking craft beer that should be sipped and savored because the flavor is just that good. And just like I like my beers, I like these donuts. While they don't taste exactly like the beers that the batters are made out of (don't worry, I'm 99% sure these are kid friendly), you can definitely get hints of the flavor in these delicious little pastries. They have their signature flavors, like the Bernie (made from GLBC Dortmunder - similar to a glazed donut) and they usually have one or two new ones they are experimenting with. My favorite is the Boss Hog - a maple bacon donut made with some kind of bourbon nut brown ale (does it matter that I can't remember the name - it has BACON on it!). 

Disclaimer - they have some weird hours and they sell out QUICKLY, so check their website or social media pages to stay up to date on the inventory levels.","50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA",5,"2014-07-08",2,"review",2

Craft beer (mostly local) + donuts, what's not to love?! It's obvious a lot of work and creativity goes into handcrafting these yummy treats.

The shop itself is quirky, vintagey, fun, and has a lot of flair. It's 100 percent my kinda place. The walls are adorned with faux animal heads in addition to showing some CLE love. There's a little bit of seating up front by the windows to enjoy a Brewnut & a cup of joe. 

From the sounds of it, Brewnuts will be calling Professor Ave. home for the next ten months or so (via the Tremont Storefront Incubator Project) until they identify their next and hopefully permanent spot. As for hours, it seems they're open at 9am Saturday & Sunday until they sell out (which is QUICK) and afternoons (like after 4ish) during the week, a donut happy hour if you will. Basically, just check their Facebook - they keep Brewnut lovers updated on there. Parking is out front on the street. 

Pricing is currently at $3 bucks for a single sweet ring of deliciousness, $16 for a half dozen, & $32 for a dozen. 

I have to say that I absolutely admire this business - it's local and it's inspiring to see a small biz turn into a success. They have a lot of pride in their city and show so much gratitude to their customers in person and via social media. I wish them the best and cannot wait to see what they do next!

Check their FB page for details on the donuts, but everything we tried was amazing.  My favorite is the Boss Hog, made with Elevator Brewing Company's Angry Goat Nut Brown Ale aged in Whiskey Barrels with bacon on top.  I don't usually like maple, but the maple glaze is subtle.  The Bumbler - crafted with Fatheads Bumble Berry Honey Blueberry Ale has a lemon glaze and is sweet & tart. I'm a big fan of lemons & berries together.  The Nutty Monkey - made with Fatheads Goggle Fogger Hefe-Weizen banana donut with crushed banana chips on top is moist & crunchy.  Perfection!

The shop is cute but small, and they don't bake the donuts on site so once they're out they are OUT. Flavors also seem to change regularly. The day I was there (in May as I am slow to review) they had six options to choose from: oreo, maple bacon, glazed, raspberry, coffee, and lemon shortbread. I, of course, ordered one of everything. The donuts are a bit pricey at $3 each, but well worth the occasional splurge.

I think the Rising Star was my favorite but they were all good. Price is an issue, at least for me. But you can get a half dozen for 16 so it helps a bit.

I am pretty sure that these little bites of bliss are created by unicorns out of magic and beer. They're fluffy, they're flavorful, and they leaving me wanting another one.  I love that the donut itself is not sweet, just flavorful.  Yeasty and fluffy with a touch of beer taste, just enough to make it oh-so-delicious without making it taste less like a doughnut than a drink.

I really don't like donuts, but since I do love craft beer and also love Cleveland/Tremont, I was excited to try this place out.  These donuts are unlike anything else; I never would have guessed how well beer can amp up a donut!  They are so much more sophisticated than your average dunkin; with depth and flavor that goes far beyond bland dough coated in sugar.  There is also something to be said for the awesome owners, who truly love their customers and the City of Cleveland; they are the type of people that you just want to succeed.  On the flip side; I'll never bring these donuts in for the office because I can't afford it.  Even on a special occasion ordeal, I'd never order Brewnuts in bulk over my favorite cupcakes or cannolis, which happen to be less expensive and even more tasty (in my opinion).","50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA",4,"2015-07-02",0,"review",0

Not at all like your typical donut that may be fried or lacking in taste. Though the donuts are made with beer, there isn't an overwhelming taste of beer, rather a nice blend of all of the flavors. Most options come with a little something extra sprinkled on top, but know the longer the garnish sits the higher the chance it may soften (not ideal for pretzels) but that is the sign of fresh ingredients. Judging the way they have been selling out, this shouldn't be a big problem.

Any emotion related to this amazing venture is summed up by connotation of that math right there (because the only math you need is doughnut math, let's be real.). 
       However, the conceptt could have gone horribly wrong, like it would perhaps be if I tried to do so.  But in the skillful hands of the owners/bakers/awesome people, the concept is executed perfectly. Every single 'brewnut' I've had here has been absolutely fantastically delicious.  A plus is that they have some staples but consistently create new concoctions on a daily basis, which is a pleasant surprise.
    The brewnuts you'll get here are some of the best doughnuts you could find and full of artfully crafted flavor.  My only negative, which is an important piece of advice in itself, is that they usually run out fairly early in the morning so get there early if you want to grab a dozen for the day.

And on a cold wintry night, there's nothing more satisfying than classic French cuisine to fuel and fortify a body against the chill.

Or if you're me, be a glutton and not be able to focus on anything else but a couch on which to play beached-whale during the entire trip home. I tried to solo this meal and perhaps that was not a good call. But I digress! Let's talk about the food.

After I settle in at my table, an amuse comes out from the kitchen - a butternut soup with coconut foam. The scent of five-spice wafts up from the hot ceramic shot-glass and it is a delicious way to warm up. Quite nice.

A hot bowl of French onion soup is up next - not too salty, really nice flavour, and islands of floating toasted crisps tangled in a mess of melted cheese. It's a hefty portion of soup, good for sharing. Of course, I ate it all by myself.

The kitchen clearly thought I didn't have enough to eat this evening (I had two - yes two - mains still yet to come), so a small quenelle of a duck terrine on a crisp gets placed in front of me. Meaty and a little vinegary, this mouthful was a nice way to perk up the taste buds again. A nice and unexpected treat.

I couldn't resist and got the house-made pasta of the night: Linguine with pulled boar, mushrooms, and laced with truffle oil. There was mention of tomatoes, but it was a fairly light note. Rich and delicious, this was a deceptively large portion of pasta due to the plate being more bowl-like than you'd think. Very filling and worth a try if they still have it on the menu.

By now I was pretty full. And what's next? Cassoulet. It landed on the table and this plate of beans, half a sausage, and two confit duck legs mocked me. The peanut gallery of lardons laughed. I tried valiantly, but I got through half a leg, a slice of sausage, and a few spoonfuls of beans before I called it quits.

The waitress enquires if I want dessert? I'm stuffed, but of course!

I opted for a pot de crème trio (it's small, right?) in mango, berry, and apple (in order of preference). The mango was light and delicious and not as mangoey as it could have been. Better that way, I think. The berry (cassis, I think), in contrast, was quite strong and worked well. The texture was a bit off though. I'd have opted to pass on the apple in the end.

A pot of loose-leaf tea (earl grey. hot.), strong and black, accompanied dessert in an effort to make more room in my stomach. It did its job, though I still felt like I was going to explode.

All in all, a promising new neighbourhood place I'd return to sometime (can't think about when right now - too full). Added bonus is the fact that real French gets bandied about between the FOH and kitchens. Adds that extra je ne sais quois to the evening.

Frisee salad w/ lardons and poached egg: nice and yolky, an excellent salad.

Pate main served w/ toast and jam. Meaty w/o being salty and the jam added a sweet note. Lovely.

Cassoulet: It was -5C out so this dish really hit the spot. Two confit duck legs, rosemary herbed sausage and white beans slow cooked until al dente and flavorful. The duck legs might've been a little chewier than usual, but still a good, hearty, filling dish.

Roast wild boar chop: Cooked medium w/ an excellent, slightly sweet glaze, mashed potatoes, baby carrots and crunchy broccolini. The flavors and textures were wonderful, an excellent dish.

Chocolate cake: deep, chocolatey flavor, with just enough sweetness to allow you to enjoy the chocolatey taste w/o being sugary, sickly sweet.

Pear poached in wine and honey, served w/ vanilla creme in phyllo. Man, this dessert was amazing. I'll definitely get this again.

I also read the National Post's (http://tinyurl.com/4htvoet) review the day after visiting and although it was a little bit harsher than I would have said it, it was on the money. 

A bit of confusion finding our reservation at first, but once done we were warmly shown to our table. The wine list was a little overpriced ($14/glass for middle of the road) for what it had on it, but of the two glasses that I tried, they were nice accompaniments to what I ate. 

I started with the quintessential escargots and my wife had soup of the day - creme of pear and parsnip. The escargots were excellent. Plump and nestled nicely in butter and Gruyere. The soup was thick and rich and thankfully wasn't overpowering in either pear or parsnip. Nice little starter. 

We also shared another special of the day - a small order of rabbit rillette with crostini. A little heavy on garlic but a light dish that was rather quickly devoured. 

Mains next. I had the wild boar which was...ok. I partially blame myself as when I had the mental image in my head, it wasn't the same as the pork chop that appeared in front of me. The Yukon mash and carrots were delicate and lovely to eat. The roasted garlic / jus that came with the boar didn't add too much to the taste that was just familiar. The $27 price for this plate was a tad too much as well. 

Now, the moules et frites that my wife ordered were fantastic. Neither of us had ordered very many tomato-based mussel dishes (used to wine or curry/cream based) and this order was brilliant. Mussels were big fat bastards and picked up the broth flavour very well. Extra bread for dipping was definitely needed. Couldn't even finish the order. The mini-string frites were very tasty and the perfect lemon aioli dip was tip top. 

The place filled quickly past 7-7:30 p.m. with every demographic possible, showing that this little placed is like by all. We planned it well time-wise, as with our table tucked in the corner near the ordering station, the place gets packed by 9. 

Staff were very friendly, pleasant and timed their visits perfectly. At least one server speaking French with a multitude of tables. 

Going back to the Post's article, I don't know how the reviewer ate for $80, taxes in. Our meal with 2 glasses of wine, a pastis ordered with a shared dessert was $135 before tip.","205IU_t4t0kzCfHN06fyKg",3,"2011-02-28",2,"review",2

I almost hate to write a review of this place, because I don't want anyone to know about it and thus be able to keep this wonderfully intimate French restaurant all to myself and my husband. Every time we come here, it's not very crowded and we're free to make goo-goo eyes at each other over dinner without making anyone want to toss their moules frites. But, this place is too sweet not to share, so consider yourselves warned if you spot us in a corner, canoodling over crevettes. ;) 

Standouts here include the escargot poutine (yes, you read that right!) and the coq au vin. Both items are rich, hearty, and perfect stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. I also really like the duck breast with cassoulet, which is another hearty choice. The filet and frites are also good, but nothing special. 

The wine list is decent; on the small side, but well-curated. The server, a lovely Montreal woman, sets the atmosphere with her lovely French accent and welcoming (if slightly frazzled) attitude. Food comes out reasonably quickly, and I've already blathered on about the romantic, intimate atmosphere. Highly recommended.","205IU_t4t0kzCfHN06fyKg",4,"2012-02-26",3,"review",3

When you walk in, there is a luggage section, jewelry counter, cosmetic/body care section (scan the markdowns), wallets & handbag section (more later), lingerie section ( check the bras, ladies), and shoe department (I always check this section). Towards the middle of the store is the women's clothing and furniture (nice selection, reminds me of Pier 1 Imports, but cheaper). The section behind the shoe department is the housewares, decor, cooking, books (small but worth checking out), small gifts (stationery), & linens departments. The other end of the store is men's clothing and kid's clothing, plus toys too. The front caps near the registers (down the way from the luggage and entrance/exit doors) feature certain items usually related to the season or closest holiday, like Jelly Belly jelly beans around Christmas time. 

The selection of designer handbags varies from Coach, Dooney & Bourke, Michael Kors, Kathy Van Zeeland, LeSportsac, and many other brands, at prices near outlet store prices. The last few racks are all markdowns. 

We came here a couple weeks ago and saw Dina Titus shopping (with her mom)- I hadn't seen her in person since I took her class at UNLV. She looks the same!

If I am alone, I can browse all the departments. I usually come here a lot around Christmas time. It's easy to find gifts here. Sometimes, there is a good amount of Harry & David products (fine foods- delicious- you need to try it- we've introduced it to some family & friends).

The COCOA TEA O-M-G. I bought a bag and it lasted less than a week. Perfect for the season!

I am willing to spend money on their matchas and more of the cocoa tea. It's basically cocoa shells, I suggest mixing it with a base tea, and adding some milk to get a delicious tea latte. But if you want a skinny hot cocoa, just make a tea of cocoa shells and pour some steamed milk on top, IT ACTUALLY TASTES BETTER THAN CARNATION, I SWEAR. 

They could be better, though: they could offer more tea accessories (the basics: paper filters, tea tumblers...) and it's very small, so you will probably order tea-to-go.

It is a small independantly-owned shop run by Dan who is a mad scientist with tea. There are a ton of different flavors from sweet, to smokey, to creamy, to nutty, to delicate and complex. You could find teas that mimic flavors of your favorite dessert or cocktail.

In addition to selling loose teas, Dan could brew you a cup to enjoy (hot or iced).
Definitely try the Cacao tea. Cacao, not to be confused with Cocoa, is the raw bean which chocolate and cocoa is made from. The strong aroma is rich and chocolatety and the flavour is spicy and like bitter dark chocolate. Best of all it is caffine free so you can enjoy it at night.
The apple smoked bacon tea is not as scary as it sounds -- it smells awesome.

The shop which carries about a 100 different tea flavours could be very daunting to choose which tea to try, but the wall of tea is grouped in different categories: decafinated, black, green and white teas. Dan is also good at choosing the right tea for you if you are still indecisive.

Dan works on new flavours all the time, so be sure to check in once in a while to see what he has brewing (pardon the pun).

In fact it's on Adelaide Street, go west from Spadina. it's not exactly close to the intersection, you can't see it until you're walking west on Adelaide.

This is a very small place -even its door was so small. You would only notice this tea shop when you find its shop sign (or if you already know of its location).

When we entered, they looked at us blankly because they were expecting someone else. I don't think they were expecting customers that day, they were holding an event to promote their new online tea subscription service (pretty cool right?)

Anyways, so the guy who helped us find the right teas was wonderful. He was patient especially in waiting for this indecisive duo to find the right teas. 

THE TEA SHOP INFO:
- super small shop
- very few selections. Still they have green, black, oolong, white, and roiboos
- minimum amount is 50g per tea
- $2 sample teas!!!!! ANY tea, comes in a cute test tube. Just $2. Pretty awesome.

The $2 tea sample is honestly the BEST thing ever. The test tube can fit enough leaves for about 2-3 cups of tea, and it's so cute. Totally fun as gifts.

I didn't give it 5 stars because there are too few selections of teas, and I didn't like most of the teas to be honest. Most of their teas have strong smelling ingredients such as cinnamon, chocolate, nuts, and especially the dessert teas (like the Tiramisu).  I personally prefer fruity, flowery, and teas that have less strong (and less contrasting) smells. The fruity teas I buy do not have any sort of ""accent"" smell.

Still, please please check this place out if you're a tea lover. Try those $2 tea samples!","Q-lz4ZAYDGk0kE-P2Hncsg",4,"2013-03-15",0,"review",0

Now, the food isn't too bad, and the sushi is decent. But the service is so slow and so inefficient at the Penn City Grill, that it's almost comical to watch the waitstaff run back and forth, without any rhyme or reason, because anything you ask for -- menu, silverware, napkins, check -- requires at minimum two laps around the obstacle course.

So eventually, I stopped expecting the waitstaff to come around, and just enjoyed the show. Never mind that the restaurant is at most 25% full. Stuff just takes that long.

My friend and I were both curious and stopped in one day on our way home from work. It was a Sunday and they weren't open but they gave us the hours so we could come back when they were open.  So we returned the next day after work, parked our bikes at the bike rack out front and headed in, not really sure where we were headed. 
Inside the main door is just a small security desk. The guard asked us if we had an appointment.  Nope. We told him we had come just yesterday to ask when they were open and were told we could come back today. The flyer he gave us with the hours said they'd be open and didn't say anything about needing an appointment. 
After a phone call and a few minutes of confusion, we were escorted to the back of the building and told to walk towards a guy wearing a white lab coat at the back of the property. He stood back there with a wide stance and his arms crossed in a strange intimidating way. But when we got up close, he was just an odd white hairded, mutton-chopped older man with a fun British accent. He showed us into the Museum and told us that he was just finishing up with a group of seniors (weird?) and then we would have the place to ourselves. 
The displays were really nicely put together, going over the history of John Redpath and how he came to Canada and first started his businesses.  Once we really got reading about him, it was pretty interesting. The strange museum man would pop in and out every once in a while to see if we had any questions. My only question was if they ever did tours of the actually factory so i could see how sugar was really made. He said they didn't do that because it's a food production factory and everything is all sealed up for health standards. Darn. 
It was a strange afternoon at the Redpath Museum, but a fun little piece of Toronto (and Montreal) history.","F9d_0hkJodk_mjcVmfuKrg",3,"2012-07-18",0,"review",0

My joke to our group (we had arranged for this tour midweek): For someone who works in a sugar factory, he sure isn't sweet.

har har!

Mutton Chops didn't bother to say hello. Our group, 7 parents and 11 home schooled kids ages 5 to 15 attempted a greeting when he started roaring the rules.

ooooKay!

But wait, I'm a fan? 

Yeah, a fan.

Once past the formalities, the barked orders and the chastising of an elderly woman (not part of my immediate group) for eating nuts (against aforementioned food regulations!), a great time was had. Mutton Chops turned out to be a great guide, passionate about his subject and a good story teller.

Did you know that....

You can watch the sugar boat barges unload raw sugar using giant cranes?
Redpath Senior had 17 children but 5 of them died?
You can wear a corset and not pass out?
The factory operates 7 days a week, 24 hours a day?
It takes 10 hours to take raw sugar and refine it into Redpath sugar?
The original Redpath family mansion in Montreal (now gone) included central heat and three indoor washrooms?
Brown sugar is just white sugar with the molasses added back in?

My youngest boy, 7, said, Can you believe it-- they take the molasses out and then they *add it back in*?!!

Random bonus: the museum includes a display of ""sugar art"": figures from the Harry Potter series fashioned out of sugar.

The owner, annoyed, refused saying that he ""couldn't"" replace it and that I'd have to pay for a new one. When I insisted that as the owner of the store it was indeed in his power to replace it, he angrily snatched the sausage out of the bag, slammed it into the trash can, dumped a new sausage in and shoved the open bag at me growled ""Es-tu content?"".

Initially drawn in by the bacon and salamis (in hopes that we could sneak something back home to the US), my dining partner and I returned for the outstanding sausage sandwiches.

We both ended up getting swiss cheese infused sausages-- positively bubbling with mild, gooey cheese-- with mustard and pickles as a nod to a classic Cuban sandwich. Seeing everyone else order saurkraut we opted for a little of that too... and were stunned. This, friends, is one of the most perfect sandwiches I've ever eaten.

The baguette on which the toppings were served was chewy, crunchy, and hot. The saurkraut-- something I'm not normally a fan of-- was crunchy and fresh and provided a nice mildly acidic counter to the rich, fatty sausage. Solid mustard and tasty pickles. 

My dining partner and I sat in silence just savoring these sandwiches.

To note-- if ordering from the food cart, pay inside first and get a number. Kudos to the friendly clerk willing to make us sandwiches even though we hadn't done this formality before stepping in line.

Then onto the ordering - it's fast casual style.   I was sort of reminded of a trip to the doctor's office because it was a really clinical experience.   The lady at the counter was really slow and rather uninspired by her work.  Turns out we'd interrupted her lunch, which she went out to the dining area to eat after she waited on us.

The food was mixed.  The jalapeño popper panini I had was pretty good.  Creamy and cheesy, with a punch from some sliced jalapeños.   It was pretty large too.  The hash brown tater tots were straight from the Ore Ida bag.  Not bad, but pretty generic.   The sandwich, tots, bottle of water, and random bag of chips I didn't order came to just over $10.

After 20 years of different dealers, mechanics, auto shops, body shops, I have finally found a place I would total use again and recommend. A true find.

They are the old-school, neighborhood model of what capitalism is supposed to be: they believe in keeping your business long-term--so they treat you fairly, honestly, explain what they're doing and why, treat you with absolute integrity, and trust that you'll keep coming back.  And I will.

Thanks, Chris and Dave for the great service and being $300 to $750 less than all the rest of the estimates that I received.  You guys ROCK!","5sxXLvgc38bn98VcpvRcnQ",5,"2014-02-10",4,"review",0

"3599",1,"kNV9dPP9EQod-x0SSVaV5Q","H1wAnJaFcmjNwm6oIJ8RHw","I just came back here on a recent visit and I was somewhat disappointed.  Let me start by saying I think Gina is fantastic.  She is the ultimate when it comes to designs.  If all you are interested in is a fabulous, unique, design that you probably can't get elsewhere, than this is the place for you.  BUT... the quality of the gel mani itself has gone down.  Way down.  I was disappointed for so many reasons.  My design was nice though.  First, i came in with existing gel polish.  I guess the way they do things here is to not remove your old gel polish?  To me, that's odd.  They just file down as much as they can.  I've never heard that before.  It's odd to me and it's sloppy and when you put the new polish on, the new polish puts on another layer, which makes your nails look thick, and then not smooth.  Which is how mine looked - lumpy.  But because there is glitter and stones and what not, hard to see the lumps but I could see it.  And then, the peeling starts because your new gel mani is not sitting on fresh primed nails.  My gel mani didn't last even a week before the corners started peeling.  By then, I was back in LA so I couldn't go back to get it fixed.  Secondly, I told Gina before we started that one of my nails had broken and that I had crazy glued it.  I pointed it out and thought she would fix it before doing anything. Nope.  She filed that nail along with the rest of them and put the gel polish on top like the rest.  No additional glue, nothing.  The minute I got back to my friend's house, it was already cracked.  Lastly, I reiterate, I think she's a nice lady, and very talented, but, also very distracted.  She did one nail, walked away.  Did another two nails, walked away.  Did a couple of more nails, walked away.  That's how it went until my nails were done.  It's pretty frustrating.  I'm not sure if it was just an off day but for me, when I pay this much money to get my nails done, this is not the quality I like.","9dro9HGXfJ4g6IzxDWD9UA",3,"2015-10-14",0,"review",0

I have continued to be a loyal customer because they are clean, friendly and do a good job. At first I was getting a regular manicure every week but Gina suggested I get gel polish. I was skeptical because I had gotten gel at another shop and it didn't last longer than 10 days so not worth the extra money. Gina said they must not have prepped my nails correctly so I agreed to let her give me a gel manicure. Well I'm glad I did because I have gotten gel manis from Gina ever since and can go 3-4 weeks between, depending on when I tire of the color I chose.  Gina is the best so she is consequently very busy so I recommend making an appointment. Even with an appt there might be a small wait if her prior client asks for extra services because she likes to make everyone happy so doesn't say no. She'll give you the same service when you're in her chair.

My cousins who frequent this place recommended I try this nail shop & made an appointment for me. I am SO happy they did. The gel color selection is ridiculous -- just rings and rings of color samples. They had my favorite OPI color in gel so of course I defaulted for that (Lincoln Park After Dark). Owner's daughter is so adorable. She helps out around the shop & tends to the entering customers by offering a bottle of water & asking what services were needed. Staff is kind & welcoming as well - they do not ignore you when you walk in like some other nail salons do. I had the first appointment with Gina for a gel manicure & pedicure. She arrived just a minute or two after the shop opened. So kind and friendly - she is extremely thorough & does not rush through the work. She definitely pays attention to detail because as she was doing the manicure, there were a few times when the brushstrokes seemed to leave small streak-lines that were not 100% noticeable. If this was a shop in Los Angeles, it would've been left alone, but Gina made sure to correct it. She also made sure that the color was applied to the entire nail - end to end. Now I understand all the wonderful 5 star reviews about her. She even did my spa pedicure - which to me was unheard of here in Los Angeles - the manicurists ever hardly do pedicures - it was a very humbling touch to my visit. The shop got pretty busy after only 10 minutes of opening & regulars walked in and WAITED - which is another sign of good business. It is fairly small so understand there may be a wait. If I am ever in town again & need to get my nails done I am definitely returning.

It took nearly an hour for what is probably the worst manicure I've received in my life.

My big pro about this store is that the cashiers seem to always remember to give out the gift cards if you have earned one from an in store special and they always seem to remember to put the carrying strap on the big paper towels or similar items if you buy them. The only thing that is annoying in the store is the parking. There seems to be an excessive amount of handicap spots which never seem to be completely filled.

I love a good bean and cheese burrito and Roberto's has one that will inspire me to get out of bed in the middle of the night to get one. Lucky for me, they're open 24 hours. Not so lucky for my pants which have been feeling the stretch of this staple of my diet for some time now. I don't know what it is about this burrito-maybe they warm the tortilla in butter before filling it with tasty beans and cheese. Maybe it's the fact that they likely cook those beans in lard, which let's be honest, makes all the difference. I don't know, but if I knew I could live off of these without dropping dead of heart disease, I'd do it. 

There aren't many things I order here- the enchilada plate, the bean and cheese burrito and from time to time the carne asada nachos which are a day and a half's worth of calories and sodium, but worth it. I only recommend the carne asada when it comes to nachos- the chicken just has never been good when I've had it. Nothing to ruin a delicious plate of cheese and chips like dry flavorless chicken. My favorite salsa is the green-not too spicy and packs in some great tomatillo flavor. If you go inside you can get as many little containers of salsa as you want, which brings me to my next point. 

Don't get in the drive through lane unless you like to be tortured before your meal. I've made the mistake many a time of  hopping in the drive through lane because I simply didn't want to get out of my car and I regretted it every single time. It is significantly faster to park and go in because the drive through line can be a 15+ minute wait and in my experience they get the food inside the restaurant faster. I mean, I've actually pulled up at the same time as someone and have walked out with my food before the cars in front of them have received their food.

The food is consistent, the service is what you'd expect at any fast food establishment and if you avoid the drive through line I could almost guarantee a positive experience!","2nEhcvxBZk2W4x_fi0cYxw",3,"2012-05-13",1,"review",0

Quick Review™
+   They carry Thrifty Ice Cream®.

-   That Thrifty Ice Cream will cost you more than a comparable amount of same-brand ice cream with the two warm cookies at Sweet Addiction®.

Question:
Do you seek the absolute most expensive petrol in the valley aside from the one station adjacent to Sixt Rental on Warm Springs/Gillespie? 

Answer:
Then you have come to the right place here at Texaco Short Line Express Market® in Centennial. 

Question:
Do you seek to pay more than 3.50$ USD for less than one true scoop of Thrifty Ice Cream? 

Answer:
Then you have come to the right place ....

Observations since my final patronage
+ There is a station just a couple of blocks north on the West side of Durango that provides Petrol at a much lower cost. I won't name it since you know what it is: it rhythms with NARCO.

+ It's like stepping through a wormhole and landing back in the Dumbya years where petrol was forcing people to trade in their Durango®s for Toyota Camry®s and to pull the AAA scam* once a month.
(*Claim running out of gas; get roadside assistance to deliver one whopping liquid gallon of petrol to your location.)

+ I wish there were a sports book in the market so I can wager on the sports games that transpired in the past. It would make up for the overcharge on the fuel and turn me into a real life Biff. (Who wouldn't want to be Biff?)

Firsthand experiences explained in a step-by-step guide for the worthless HQ idiot reading this: step 1. I drive to the business. (I drove there.) Step 2: I open the door of the motor vehicle and step out and shut the door behind me after popping the fuel door. Step 3: I looked at the pump number. Step 4: I began walking towards the doors of the business. Step 5: I returned to the vehicle because I forgot the pump number and need to ensure I don't pay into the wrong pump. Step 6: Once again I walk towards the doors of the business. Step 7: The automatic doors -- like magic -- open for me as if I were Prince Harry, also a combat veteran like me.

Step 8: I wait for the attendant to return from wherever he is. 
Step 9: I repeat aloud the number that I have been saying to myself repeatedly and hand him the Jackson. (They really should put a woman on that denomination.)
Step 10: I say thank you. 
Step 11: I look at the ice cream on my way out. 
Step 12: I reach the motor vehicle, remove the pump, select the grade, unscrew the cap, engage the automatic draw after inserting the nozzle into the female part.
Step 13: I open the door and get inside the motor vehicle before shutting the door behind me. (There must be a reason that Oregon and New Jersey, respectively, bar civilians from pumping their own fuel.)
Step 14: I listen to KNPR, check-in on my Yelp mobile application, think about Mark Wahlberg's firefighter character in I Heart Huckabees, et. cetera.
Step 15: I hear the click of the nozzle disengaging, open the door, step out, pull the nozzle slightly out while still leaving the tip in, shake off the nozzle vigorously, place the ....

I am exhausted of the firsthand experiences. You get the point. 

Final Word™
Don't come here unless you enjoy burning money unnecessarily*. 
(*As opposed to necessarily.)

------------------------------------------

Tourists
None here: it's far from the strip.

Kids
Not good for 'em.

Dogs
Leave them at home unless they are service-providing*.

With a cute, updated website, claiming to be close to The Strip, and dogs kept in an air-conditioned playroom, they seemed to care. Before I go on, I will say upfront that these people care more about themselves than their human customers. At least our dogs were unscathed while there, but I will never go back after our disastrous experience with them. The story unfolds...
My fiancee and I planned to get married in Vegas, with our big, furry children joining us in our wedding 
ceremony. We booked them into Paradise Bay Pet Resort well in advance, and emailed scanned copies of dog vaccinations to them. In the email correspondence, they seemed like nice people and knew about our wedding plans.
When we got to Vegas from LA, we dropped the dogs off first, and it was a good 20 minute drive from the Strip to Paradise Bay (not so convenient), out near the airport. 

It is actually a warehouse-style shop fitted out as dog kennels, with a large, cement-floor playroom and sleeping quarters in little sections outside the room. At least it was cool inside. The fellow who served us was friendly but more focused on getting to know the dogs, which suited us fine. He led them one at a time into a small room to be socialised with a big collie before being allowed into the playroom.

We'd booked the $70 accomodation for our 2 big dogs. They are left in airplane crates to sleep from 11pm to 6am without water. I know our GSP drinks lots of water at night, but this is how we had to leave him. Unless you can afford $65 per dog for a small room, this is what they get. Anyway, we left them with a big bag of dog food and hoped they would be ok.

We booked a 7pm wedding the next day. I called the kennels to arrange for us to collect the dogs and return them after the event. This is when I learned that our dogs are left unattended on the premises from 6pm to 8pm, and then from 11pm to 6am, with no customer service after 6pm. Sure, the 6pm thing is reasonable, but the unattendance? What if there was a fire?
I rebooked our wedding for 5pm to fit in with the kennel times. In full wedding outfits we rushed in to the kennels at 4:30pm, smiled and said that we were in a flying hurry to collect our dogs for our wedding. The girl at the counter dolefully said she would have to check us out first, and took her sweet time to do so. I asked what we could do to speed up the process, which pissed her off. She took our payment for the night before, then dawdled out to get the dogs. 

Dogs in truck..chapel..wedding..weird chapel photography...It went by in a blur until our GSP launched himself at live, caged parrots in the Hawaiian room at the chapel. I came to my senses and realised that time must be running out. It was 5:45pm, and we had to get the dogs back! Our friends were left to collect our marriage certificate while we raced to the kennels. 

I called them to say that we were on our way, unfortunately getting the slow girl on the phone who I had already annoyed. I explained that we were on our way but a bit late. She said, ""Well, I carpool, so I can't wait around after 6pm."" I practically begged her to wait the 5 mins we would be late by. She sounded really shitty on the phone and said that maybe someone else there could wait around, but she couldn't be sure. I had a bad feeling about it, but we drove to the place because we stupidly believed in the magic of weddings and people being kind to you on your big day. Heavy traffic got us there by 6:10pm. 

Lo and behold, the glass doors were LOCKED. Nobody home, except of course the unsupervised doggies out back. We banged on the door to no avail, still in wedding outfits, and realised that we had been royally screwed, in 112 degree heat, too. So much for big wedding day. it was more like a big dog disaster. They didn't try to phone and warn us, no helpful note on the door. Nothing. You can only imagine how hopeless we felt, stuck in the heat outside a warehouse in wedding garb, with two panting dogs, in an unfamiliar city, at 6:15pm, wondering what to do next. 

We frantically called around and managed to get the dogs into Camp Bow Wow, who stay open until 7pm. It was much closer to the Strip, too, down the southern end. It was a joyful experience from the time we walked in with our dogs to the time we collected them. Lovely staff, happy dogs.

Why had we even chosen Paradise Bay Pet Resort? We did not know it was much further away, has limited opening hours, poor customer service and no supervision at night. Plus, they kept our dog food and have not bothered to contact us at all. This place is more like Customer Hell than Paradise Bay.","042AqS-UB74g841zmoCEEA",2,"2010-06-30",1,"review",0

I had tried a few places before Paradise Bay...and my dogs always seemed skittish when we picked them up. This is the ONLY place I have taken my dog where they are just as happy when I pick them up as they are when I drop them off. That means everything to me.

I had a Japanese Chin that had several health problems and I was terrified to leave her with anyone (including my husband). But, my father was (also) dying at that time, so a few times my husband and I ahd to go out of town without any notice. Each time, Paradise Bay took my dogs with no problems...and gave all the medications that she was on. My Japanese Chin, Molly, passed away a little over a year ago. But, they even sent me a card when they found out.

Currently, we have 2 larger dogs, a lab & a pit. Some places will not take pit bulls even if they pass the standard temperament tests. Paradise Bay doesn't discriminate!

The staff is always friendly, especially Brandi. They are always happy to see my dogs, and more importantly my dogs are always happy to see them! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM for daycare and/or boarding.

They offer grooming services which I find really convenient. Their rates are also really reasonable. For 2 dogs its about $40 a day of daycare (7A-7P) for daycare & $70/night for boarding (which includes the daycare!)

I, also, like that they are on Facebook so I can get in touch with them that way to schedule services. I find that really convenient.

New clients get a free day of daycare, so you can literally try them out risk free.

Like any business, they have hours of operation that you need to adhere to, and I have never found it to be a problem to get there by 7P.

This is literally the only place I trust my dogs with when I go out of town. I feel total peace of mind leaving my babies with them!","042AqS-UB74g841zmoCEEA",5,"2011-05-23",1,"review",0

We called and said we would be there in a few minutes, to which we were reassured that was fine, but traffic caused it to be 15.  When we arrived, the doors were locked and the lights were off.  We called the phone number, but there was no response.  In addition, there was no after hours (or emergency) number on the answering machine or website.  With my wife crying, I emailed the company to see if there was anything that I could do.  I waited for an hour outside Paradise.  No response.  In addition, I sent another email trying to notify them of my dog's allergies, and let them know that she had no hypoallergenic food.  I was obviously upset, and unaware of what was going to happen with my dog.  I get the following response from the owners the next afternoon (direct cut and paste): ""Hello, Our business hours our M-F, 7 am - 6 pm, and Sat and Sun, 8 am - 5 pm. You may pick your dog up anytime between those hours.""  This was the entirety of the email.  Obviously, I had already picked her up by then, but the email confirmed further that the ownership didnt even care enough to call the store to follow up on the dog that I was obviously upset about. I believe that doggy ""resort"" revenue comes from ""pet parents"" and as such, I request some amount of care and sensitivity about the welfare of my pet.  Paradise Bay ownership is obviously not the place for caring, pet parents like myself.

Their late policy states ""for every one minute late, you will be charged $1 per minute"". Which is fine, I was at fault and more than happy to pay the extra to get my dog back. But, THEY would have to BE on PREMISE to enforce that, wouldn't they?!

My dog was kept overnight against my will, without food. Without dinner (or breakfast) or allergy medicine or her own blankets. After 2 emails and 5 phone messages later, I still received no response.

On the way back from washing the car, we passed the Tango Cafe and decided it was high time we got some empanadas.  They run about $2.25 each, I think.  I also got a ""fruit ice"" which is canned fruit blended with ice.  It took the woman a few minutes to get it all together, but I would much rather wait a few minutes than have her just grab food that's been sitting under a heat lamp!  it's cash only, so keep that in mind.  Clearly she was the owner, the only employee in the whole place.  She was quiet but friendly.

My fruit ice (I got the peach kind) was refreshing as advertised, but simple.  It literally tasted like canned peaches blended with ice, but since that's exactly what fruit ice is made of, I expected and enjoyed it.  They also offer fruit smoothies if you want something that presumably tastes fresher.  We took our snacks home, and dug in.  We got four for two of us which I think is a good snack size.  The empanadas are quite small - maybe 4-5 bites each - if you wanted lunch, you might want 4 for yourself.

We tried the beef, the sausage, the chicken, and the spinach.  All were quite good - the crust looked and tasted unquestionably homemade.  They were hot and still a little shiny from the fryer.  The beef was my favorite - well seasoned, with a hint of olive flavor.  The chicken tasted very fresh.  The spinach was nice since it added a relatively healthy snack to the mix.  All of them were very good little bites.

Please come for a snack, and support a  local business.  Sounds like the coffee and pastries are really special - we didn't try either this time - so I will no doubt be back for more!","5kA4hmzNNWGGrwvoiGnIrg",4,"2011-06-01",1,"review",0

I went here exclusively for months (except for with friends in other states, where I got some pretty sub-par manicures that needed fixed) until I had to move back to Michigan!

It's a great little gem in Pittsburgh and I am planning on dropping by during any further trips to the area!

I had so few problems with their gel nails, they maintained my nails so so so well that I didn't have hang nails all year and their gel nails lasted for at least 2 weeks. I was more likely to get bored with the color or be unsatisfied with how much cuticle was showing (or get too busy and end up peeling everything and biting my nails down..) because of how fast my nails were growing than have a nail peel or chip. The only time I can remember where my nail polish DID chip within a week was one of my first few times going in, and they fixed my nails free of charge. 

They are good at doing short bitten nails as well as longer, better maintained nails. They were also really non judge mental of my nervous habits that were destroying their beautiful work.

Oh! And the free bottles of water are a normal occurrence, and not just part of a specific package. It was great! I have yet to find a replacement in Ann Arbor that is as point as this place.

I hope they find more people to work there during the summers and during school dance periods. As long as the people they hire are as good as them, I'd say they would be welcome hires!

They are always up for fitting people in, so make sure you talk with them if they're busy! I've gone shopping and come back, or just waited as a walk-in. It's worth the wait.

Tip: They do gel nails and toe nails and have a huge assortment of brands and colors their heat color changing nails are a must have! They have all of the colors and I'm so sad that no over place I've gone to even considers offering them! They make your tips look like they have a colored French manicure when it's a tad chilly outside! It's so much fun!!

The only downsides were polish was put on so-so, and the technician seemed very distracted, he never said a word to me. 

Overall I'll be back if nothing else for the cleanliness, and the price. I'd recommend to a friend. Next time I'll probably splurge for gel polish just because I find it goes on better regardless of the tech.","0oYHxYOeeoEfYVKTG-hRuw",4,"2016-03-21",0,"review",0

Edmundo's teaching style is very light hearted and he brings an essence of purity that is hard to find. It's rare that I find someone who loves his job so much, and what he loves to do is share his knowledge. He reminds me of the some Italian uncle in the movies who slaps you on the cheek and tells you that you're doing a good job. He has a way to make you feel like family and everyone there is very encouraging. Elizabeth is very technical. She is a hawk on technique and she accepts nothing but excellent execution. When I see her smile at a technique I'm practicing, I'm crying inside because all my efforts were not in vain. 

If you want to learn Argentine Tango, by far, Sunday's are the best quality for dollar value. 3 classes for $25? That's unheard of. The first class is a stretch and technique class. Now some men might think, why do I need to stretch and walk by myself, but I will stress that this is not just a warm-up class, but a class that builds awareness and sensitivity. I use it to wake up the connections in my body and be aware of limitations and work on my technique and balance. This 45 minute class will help you absorb the materials for later classes and we can all work on our individual technique.

What I also love about Sunday is that there is a class dedicated to milonga. Milonga in general is quite intimidating for most people and many instructors do this dance a disservice by just saying it's ""just a fast tango"" Edmundo can help you crack the code and demystify milonga. If you want to stand out in a pool of amazing dancers, get good in milonga, and this is the place to do it.
What I love most about these 3 classes, there's 30 minutes of practice in between the classes. Most studios boot you out after the class, and when do you practice when it's fresh in your mind? And this practice time doesn't cost a thing. So, 3 classes for $25? How can you lose?","9l1CpyG8PF_BS6P1LwBF8Q",5,"2015-01-13",1,"review",0

Btw, my esteem for them only deepens. Here's my review:  I regularly thank my lucky stars that Edmundo and Elizabeth are my teachers. I'm an avid tanguera and have taken classes with them for years, yet I'm always learning more from them. As instructors they combine a deep understanding of technique with a great love for the dance as well as vast knowledge of the history of tango. In class, they work with each student according to that student's level and know how to discern and analyze movement; that is, they can make that little correction that makes all the difference. Besides their tremendous skill, integrity, and generosity in teaching, they are wonderful people, full of humor, compassion, and intelligence. Their Tuesday night class at Hama Dance focuses on close embrace. On Sundays, students can take a 3-hour sequence of classes (or opt for just one or two segments) covering: (1) Stretching and technique, (2) milonga, and (3) tango, the latter usually focusing on open embrace movements. Typically, Edmundo and Elizabeth also give students extra time after class to practice.

I had gastric bypass at the end of July, and finding a protein shake and the right vitamins has been a nightmare. Everything is gross, protein shakes are thick and chalky, and nothing settles well in my stomach that was already sensitive before surgery.

I walked in confused and desperate. A salesperson jumped right in and listened to me babble during a low-blood sugar attack. They helped me find a protein that would meet all of my needs, provide me with energy, was affordable - and most importantly - wouldn't taste like some kind of rotting thing. 

I was skeptical though, because they are supposed to sell overpriced supplements that you don't need, right? Well, they have never treated me that way, and I'm grateful because I am poor and hungry. Not even kidding.

I came home with my 1.33lb bag of GNC Amplified 60 protein. It's supposed to be super clean, super tasty, etc. I mixed with my almond milk, still dubious, and took a sip. It mixed beautifully without getting clumpy and chalky. Every last bit of powder was blended perfectly by my blender bottle. The flavor is totally enjoyable, and it didn't upset my stomach. The salesperson did not do me wrong. 

I went back today to replace what I ran out of, and I was thrilled to find a pumpkin spice powder by the same brand. PUMPKIN SPICE PROTEIN POWDER! I am beyond thrilled with this location.

This place gets to be a bit ridiculous. I get that things are for ""personal"" use... but for the ridiculous price they cost, they should work. We bought $150 worth of merchandise for a bachelorette party. One of the things was a pack of penis balloons for $9. When we opened them and tried blowing them up for a game, they wouldn't blow up, and the one or two that did either exploded or just looked like a ball, it wouldn't fill out to look like a penis. And when they blew up you could tell from all the white lines and ""stars"" that they were really old balloons. So my sister called them to ask if she could return them because they were defective... and the response was she could have a 25% off coupon that doesn't expire. Gee...thanks... That really solved the problem of the defective product. I could understand if I bought something personal and tried it out and didn't like it... but i bought $9 worth of balloons that ruined our game. I will never go here again for the mere fact that you don't reimburse defective products, regardless of the price.

However, I will say, the staff was very fun and made us laugh! That was the ONLY positive experience about this over priced place...","DtrTCViUn9uV8TtD_eyMQg",1,"2014-06-09",0,"review",0

I absolutely love their popcorn! It's the best I've ever tasted with the widest selection of flavors.
You'll see their popcorn on display through the glass window of the stand where all the flavors are also listed. So many choices, from extra butter, cheddar cheese, white cheddar, jalapeno, ketchup, caramel... etc - If you're not sure what you want, you can always ask for a little sample!

My favorite is the white cheddar, and it's the kind of delicious cheesy flavor that I just can't put down. Whenever I'm eating a bag, I develop this automatic hand-to-mouth motion until it's nearly all gone!

Kernels popcorn seasonings can also be purchased on site or in grocery stores. One thing I'm a little confused about is the use of monosodium glutamate which is found in most of their popcorn sold in store, however the bottles you buy are labelled MSG free. Perhaps they have different recipes...
For flavor and ingredient info: http://www.kernelspopcorn.com/pdf/allergen.pdf

Prices are what keep me in control and prevent me from getting a bag whenever I'm at the mall, because they're not cheap!
A small bag of popcorn is around 5$ and the larger bags are close to 10$. Prices vary depending on flavor.

They have a discount if you buy 2 bags, the 3rd is free.

The other slight drawback is the fact that this Montreal location does not take part in special ""flavor of the month"" featured on their official Facebook page. Other locations across Canada offer new, experimental flavors like ""Mac and cheese"" although when I inquired about it, staff was unaware.

Still very recommended, Kernels is far superior to movie theater popcorn, store bought stuff or anything you make at home.","ChK3H2ipLFK2zQBFX_CEUw",4,"2013-03-22",0,"review",0

to see if you even like it, devil dog gives you one free personal trainer try out session. i walked in thinking that this might be like other personal trainers... they talk to you alot, they try to sell you on additional crap, and at the end of the day you feel like you worked out but not like you were dying. i was so wrong. not only did my coach/trainer (Ron - he's awesome) skip all the crap, he worked me out so hard i felt sure that i was going to never move again. it was intense. for 30 min you are constantly moving and using muscles that you never knew existed. i was completely sold after the free try out and have been going now for 8 weeks. i couldnt be happier. my endurance is up, my weight is down, and im learning how to box. pretty bad ass if i do say so myself.

give it a shot. its a lot of hard work but it really is worth it in the end. you'll leave everytime feeling like you accomplished something and feeling better about yourself :).","746qkIb4hrCAiw-dCHXFYg",5,"2011-12-06",1,"review",1

For whoever owns this place, it was obviously an afterthought for some useless land. From the road, the place looks virtually abandoned. The course itself is built on a parking lot (which is visible through some of the holes) and the clubhouse is nothing but an old construction trailer. 

The course itself features little to no creativity and all of the courses are completely uneven. Starting from the first hole, the ball simply rolls back to the starting position no matter where you managed to land it. The rest of the holes are pretty much the same, making this course a game of luck. The holes are so lop-sided that the ball won't even sit on several of the starting points.

It's also worth noting the road leading to this place is just about as bad, huge dips and uneven asphalt everywhere might cause you to lose a wheel on top of the $5 you probably just lost on this place.","2wGXR2aHOCNJpV4pWU5Zxg",1,"2016-07-11",0,"review",0

And I must say I look 100% better in these bras. They are gorgeous and natural looking; they actually fit me. I was wearing the wrong sizes all this time. And Katherine could not have been lovelier or more accomodating. Their panties are a real treat as well; I felt like a kid in a candy store. It was so much fun! And I love that they keep all of my stats in their computer so I can call and order more with free shipping, because I live in Los Angeles. Every woman needs to have an appointment here.

Now I know that I was one of them! La Lingerie is an appointment-only boutique (although there are open house times as well), specifically designed to provide thorough and educational bra fittings as well as browsing time. She made me immediately comfortable -- particularly important in a business like this, because lingerie fittings are very personal. I never felt rushed or exposed, and Katherine spent a lot of time talking with me about what kinds of items would be most useful for me, then making suggestions.

Everything I bought (both that day and by special order -- and yes, she will both ship and file a wishlist for later purchases -- thank goodness, since I just moved out of state!) has been terrific. I haven't noticed any weak spots or wear and tear, and I am so much more comfortable in a bra that fits well.

I'm usually pretty thrifty, and honestly never would have even considered La Lingerie if my husband hadn't treated me to a gift certificate for my birthday. The shop asks that you put $100 down to make an initial fitting appointment, and you should be aware that you are likely to spend at least that much. I considered rating a star down solely for expense, but decided that this experience (and education) was truly worth it! If you've spent years looking for a bra that fits, go see Katherine.

I'm not used to spending so much on clothing and I was concerned about the possible buyer's remorse, but it never happened.  Every time I wear my t-shirt bra I feel confident that I made a great decision.  I cannot emphasize enough that all my lady friends should make an appointment here, they won't be disappointed.

So after passing La Lingerie many times on my bike, I made a commitment to buy myself some nice bras. The owner spent an hour with me in a one-on-one appointment to properly fit me and help me find the right bras for me. She listened to what I didn't like about my current bras. She was very friendly, approachable, and easy to work with - and rapport is especially important when you are in your underwear.

It turns out that the size VS had fitted me with was 4 inches too big around the ribs and 4 cup-sizes wrong. How does that happen?

The bras are definitely pricey, from $50-$150. I found several that look and feel great around $70-$80. That's about 1.5 times what I was paying at VS, but this was worth the splurge. As the other reviewer noted, I had to make an appointment, but there was no payment prior to the fitting when I signed up. The owner must have dropped that policy.

Very small, very little meat and nothing short of what you could get at the supermarket. To add insult to injury, they had asked for the kebab with nan bread but the guy behind the till did not realize that (we think his English wasn't so great). I can only say we've had better kebabs in Edinburgh for much less money. It's a shame we didn't just go for the set meals for 2 (which we only noticed half way into the meal) as that would probably have been better.

They're friendly, affordable, flexible and extremely knowledgeable...it may sound corny but they treat every customer like family and in the city, that's hard to come by.

When booking, the phone rep has always been extremely helpful and friendly - covering all the bases so there are no surprises come moving day.  How much stuff do you have, what size truck would you prefer, do you need wardrobes, etc, etc.  When you call you may get the answering machine but don't be put of!  They don't advertise anywhere but word-of-mouth recommendations mean they're always busy but no fear, they will get back to you and you won't regret it!  

On moving day, the movers arrived right on time - 2 guys in total. One of them had helped me move a couple of years ago and remembered me and where I'd lived before, which was great (especially since I was moving back to that area).  Really nice guys - friendly and polite without letting it slow them down.  They did a quick assessment of how much and what kind of stuff I had and then got right to it.  I have a fair amount of furniture (big pieces too) so there's always some tricky maneuvering to be done but they do it quickly and efficiently without any problems.  They also ask all the right questions when loading and unloading and take care to shrink wrap and blanket everything that needs it.  It's like friendly neighbours (who have a truck!) helping you move...

In 2 1/2 hours they had everything packed...bedroom, living room, dining room, kitchen and office.  Then they unpacked everything in less time than that!

The whole move (including transport) took just over 5 hours and cost approx. $520 including the sizeable tip we gave them for rocking the move so brilliantly.

Seriously...if you're moving in the Toronto area, it doesn't get any better than this!  Highly recommended!","9g1PWYfQ4UGW8hBtOlHTpA",5,"2009-06-15",2,"review",1

I contacted several companies based on similar reviews & suggestions. However, these guys sounded professional & aware of the job requirements. They gave me an estimate of 3 hours & actually finished unloading in only 75 minutes. I asked them to help me with assembling a couple of items since their minimum charge is 2 hours & they were done in the remaining 45 minutes.

They're polite, quite & don't waste time taking breaks. They're also prompt & take care of the items they're handling. They may not be the cheapest in the market but then again quality has a price.

If you think of moving in GTA, I'm sure they'll provide you with the help you need & you won't regret it.","9g1PWYfQ4UGW8hBtOlHTpA",4,"2010-03-12",1,"review",1

Pros: Very pleasant service on the phone.  Showed up on time.  Wrapped large furniture in saran wrap like plastic.  Disassembled bed, and assembled again.

Cons: Showed up with three movers although we only asked for two and then said three would cost $110 an hour and get the job done faster.  The move took 4.5 hours with three workers moving a 1bdrm apartment with no dining room into a 2 bdrm condo.  They got lost and did not call our cell phone, and therefore wasted 30 minutes of our time (which we had to still pay for).  Broke our mirror even though they wrapped it.  Dirtied our couch and mattress, even though they were wrapped, by dragging them on the ground.  One of the workers talked incessantly, argued with the others and used our bathrooms repeatedly (about 10 times - we kid you not).  The others took several smoke breaks.

So even though they had 3 workers, one to load and unload, and two to carry, we basically only saw one toilet using dude dragging and bringing in our stuff.   Probably because they simply did not get along.  We had also moved all of our clothing and and several car loads of items out ourselves the previous day to make it easier for the movers.

Completely not worth it, and we would NEVER use or recommend this company to anyone else.","9g1PWYfQ4UGW8hBtOlHTpA",1,"2011-04-16",4,"review",2
"3752",5,"JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg","leJhdsZfd6KqObra3Ybtpg","This was my first experience using movers - prior to this move I'd successfully moved to nine apartments with the help of friends and pizza parties - so I have little to compare it to. 

When three friends helped me move the same amount of stuff to my last apartment, the move took 2.5 hours. With two moving professionals it took 3.5 hours plus thirty minutes' travel time to the new place. I was anticipating that it'd take less than three hours and would cost about $250 but it ended up costing $400 plus tip. I still haven't figured out the math but that seems like a lot more than I was quoted. Whatever - at least I didn't have to lift a box, right?

The movers were almost half an hour late but luckily I wasn't in a rush to get out of my current place or into my new one. The two guys, Nathan and Jordan, were very friendly and professional and had done many, many moves before this one. 

I'm pretty sure part of the reason the move took so long was because they wrapped so much of stuff in blankets and bubble - a lot of it unnecessarily. The instructions that I gave were basic - nothing was really fragile and certainly nothing was antique or vintage. Just throw it in the truck and let's go. At one point I saw one of the guys wrapping my shitty 1980s 19"" TV as if it was a rare Faberge Egg - this is the same TV that I couldn't shake on Craigslist for $20.

They didn't bring the standing wardrobes as advertised and also requested - because of this I had to wrap my hanging clothes in garbage bags at the last minute and most of them barely it into my new closet intact - everything kept falling off the hangers and onto the floor. Needless to say this was a huge nuisance. I was most looking forward to seeing this marvel of moving.

The movers aren't insured to bring you to your new apartment as a passenger in their truck, so if like most people in the city you don't have access to a car, be prepared to take a cab or beg a friend (my method) to drive you to your new apartment. I didn't know about this rule so luckily a friend was able to pull through at the last minute. If the moving company beats you there they won't get started till you arrive so it's worth it to leave a little earlier than they do. 

Nothing was broken or damaged and I was overall happy with the move - just wish it had taken less time and not been so pricey. Be prepared to spend more than you had anticipated and you'll be OK. 

Also, try to have water or some other beverage handy for the movers - they were sweating up a storm and it was 30C outside (and probably in my apartment as I'd already turned off the A/C), and I had packed all my glasses and had nothing to drink. So think ahead on this one!

I looked at the videos and photos & really liked how all the DJ's seem to get in the crowd and get people moving, dance with them, etc. & the reviews all seemed to say the same. We were put in contact with DJ JJ and met up and right from our first conversation, my now husband and I knew not only that we wanted to hire him, but that we would be considering him a friend from here on out!! DJ JJ was very responsive throughout the planning and leading up to the wedding. We spoke about the method that we wanted to use with our approach to the wedding and I told him that I have seen bride's stress about the playlist in the past and I didn't want to do that. He provided a spreadsheet for me to list out my important songs that I wanted played as well as 'do play,' 'don't play,' 'ceremony songs or style,' etc type of lists. Come wedding day, he was early, he was fun, & DEFINITELY exceeded my expectations!! He definitely got the crowd going, danced with us, played fun games that had everyone laughing. Here is the thing about my guests... I have the party animals, we had some kids, we have the quiet reserved and judgmental people... and I was afraid that we couldn't target all groups with one type of music. BUT he did!

Overall, it was great! My only complaint was that I got a blocked nape instead of a tapered nape, but it was partially my fault for not asking, I'm just used to every barber opting for a tapered nape. I've read that blocked napes are supposed to make your neck look thicker, so Dominic (the barber) must have thought I had a chicken neck (joking)! Besides that, Dominic took off so much weight and my cut looked exactly as I wanted it and he worked with my hair the way it was. I also came on a Monday and it was convenient that it was open at that time when most barber shops are closed or have limited hours. 

 For $30($5 tip) it was worth it, might shop around next time though but I would not hesitate to come back here again if I had to.","-D24iSlpY6KhaDbi_bRv9g",4,"2015-07-21",0,"review",0

My dentist referred me to this place for a root canal (and like Chad, I was wondering what the hell is an endodontist??)  The office is very bright,clean, modern with new magazines--A++. I kinda of wanted to wait a little longer so I could get through the latest Us Weekly and Star issues.

But then root canal time came.....and they couldn't have been friendlier. I told them how scared I was and they assured me that everything would be alright and it would be a quick. painless process. I've never had a root canal before and after hearing about root canals gone wrong and how horrible they are to go through (ok and possibly from watching Little Shop of Horrors too much as a kid and thinking dentists are out there to hurt me) was a bit apprehensive. They numbed me up, let me know that if I felt any pain just to raise my hand and started to drill. And you know what? it wasn't bad at all! 

Soon, they were finished and I was like ""Huh, that's it? Really, that's it?"" They explained the post-procedure care in depth and Dr. Brofsky even let me know about an Italian restaurant or two to try that were unknown to me. Working on my grill and talking restaurants? Hell yes!  When can I get my next root canal??","88gtlWPyUJ-WeM6NfsKWhg",5,"2011-01-28",2,"review",1

As far as the office staff, Dr. Brofsky himself and the general ""dental procedure"" experience goes, I'd rate 5 stars. They are nice to engage in conversation with, they are able to make appointments quickly, they keep patients for as long as they say they will and they answer any questions you may have before, during and after your procedure.

I would give a much lower rating to things like cost, or maybe better put, fully explaining cost up front. When we made the appointment the staff was great about explaining exactly what my out of pocket would be (my portion after insurance). What they failed to mention was that the root canals themselves were going to use my entire annual allotment of benefits, leaving us with none to cover the required post-procedure crowns, or the extractions they knew were also scheduled. This was after numerous conversations during the evaluation regarding our finances being low and needing to do whatever was going to cost the least. 

I was incredibly upset to learn we had no benefit left when I called the general dentist to schedule the crowns. This was then made worse when I called to cancel the extraction appointment and was told that Dr. Brofsky's office had actually called to notify them that our benefit was gone the day of the root canals (yet no one thought to mention this to us, either that day or when we were discussing cost). 

Yes, it is ultimately our job, as the policy holder, to know what our benefits are, but, if you are anything like me, it might as well be in another language when you try to decipher it on your own. If a practice is able to tell you what your benefits will and will not cover, what your portion is, etc. it'd be easy to add ""but after this you won't have any benefit left to cover the rest of the work you need done."" 

Despite us mentioning our financial strain, and the fact that we could wait for the root canals (because there was no pain) if it was going to cause us more, the procedures were scheduled and only the actual ""out of pocket"" was ever mentioned. This left us feeling that making their fees was the primary concern and thus getting us scheduled before the extractions (which were more urgently needed) ensured they are who got the money. We are now in a position of having to come up with an outrageous amount of money to cover the crowns and extractions at 100% when the root canals/crowns could have easily waited.","88gtlWPyUJ-WeM6NfsKWhg",3,"2015-07-01",0,"review",0

So when touring the area you are easily able to explore other ethnic areas as well.

Toronto's China Town offers shopping bargains galore, all sorts of markets loaded with varying goods include some of the most exotic of fruits and vegetables and the best of what are real authentic Chinese restaurants with hardly any of them including those cheap American New York styled Chinese crap such as General Tao's Chicken.

Was crowded but never felt crowded; always a private spot nearby.
Beautiful fire to warm up by.
Was offered free locks and waters. Also given a coupon for our next visit along with a scented candle (nice touch!).

What I didn't like:

Changing room is small (men's).
There is a much larger changing room located in the middle of the layout (nowhere near the entrance) which is much more accommodating and nicer looking.

I was really disappointed with the atmosphere of the spa. When we were greeted, we were given a half-assed tour by a guide, who had no enthusiasm. She did insist on silence being very important at this spa and enforced. She indicated where on the property we could chat freely. We thought this was nice: I like to enjoy hydrotherapy in the most calm, quiet environment possible.

However, we were the only guests enforcing the silence rule: other guests chatted freely all over the property, passing by personnel who did not ask them to lower their voices. In a rest area, a lady had a picnic, right in front of a no food allowed sign. Of course when a member personnel come in, he greeted her and she continued her picnic.

The promise of a relaxing experience started off poorly with the locker room so crowded that it reminded us of a public restroom amidst a holiday celebration. There was not enough room to put one's bag down, forget about changing in dignity without having someone's hair or wet towel constantly brushing against you. Next we headed to the wirlpool to finally wind down. Well, as i was trying to say a quiet word to my friend, a guard came out running to give me the warning that no talking was allowed. We said ok, we ll try our best. Then as one of us was wispering something about his experience with the spa, the guard rushed back to tell us that now we are given a second warning since silence is to not only be practiced but to be enforced upon all the club visitors. Apparently, my duty was to keep my mouth shut so a) others could enjoy - i suppose silence is the uttermost ingredient of enjoyment in this particular spa and b)  those having massage upstairs would not be bothered by our conversations. To top it off, the guards would stand around the pools and stare at the people to enforce the 'silence rule' which certainly was not only aggravating but rather inappropriate for an environment that was to relax your body and soul.  Maybe if this was a prison spa, i would accept it but hey you dont pay an entrance fee in that type of setting. 
Angry and frustrated, we asked the guards about the part of the spa where talking was allowed. Sufficient to say that it was the case on just about 10% of the property where we headed to looking to finally relax and enjoy ourselves. Indeed once there we could certainly chat freely while taking a pleasant dip in the only pool available that for some sad reason resembled a glorified home tub and as such could accomodate somewhere in the range of 6-8 people - unless we were willing to climb on top of each other or stand shoulder to shoulder with the strangers - which believe me, we were not going to do. Having had enough, we decided to leave. Oh if only that was easy.

She suggested ""something natural"", and I thought that sounded good.

As she was working, she applied a number of creams and oils before and after.  The waxing process itself was great.  It hurt, like waxing does, but after peeling away a strip of wax, she would rub the area lightly.  I can't complain about the process itself.  She asked me to take a look after she was finished, and my eyebrows seemed sculpted.  I thought I was happy with them...

However, as the day progressed, I liked the finished brow less and less.  It's really a lot more thin than I am used to.  It doesn't look natural to me.  And the arch of the brow shape doesn't seem symmetrical.  Also, one side seems to have more straggling hairs than the other on the outside edge.  It doesn't look good to me.  When I got my brows waxed for the first time from the inexpensive nail salon, I walked out thinking, ""hey, I still look like me, but cleaned up"".  After walking out of my brow wax with Tracy, I just wish I had my eyebrows back.

So, 2 stars based solely on how I feel my eyebrows look.  Maybe if you have a clearer sense of how you like your brows done and can communicate that, Tracy is a good choice.  The overal experience with Tracy and the salon is great, but I'm really anxious for my brows to grow out.","DIBBksrk-TyljC7npQiKSw",2,"2012-01-27",1,"review",0

Furthermore, people should be aware that Creative Carpet Repair is not a local company. They are a nation-wide referral service. What this means is, if you call their nation wide call center for carpet service, and they send out a local company to do the work. The kicker is they charge the company a referral fee...which is in-turn passed along to the customer (you).

All of them. Individually. They actually said ""Jenny, you are going to love it."" They also warned me that it would cost a pretty penny.

Correct on all fronts.

It was perhaps for this reason I had totally and utterly ignored it until recently. It opened a wee while ago but I just never went out of my way to go. But now I've been in I can't help but imagining my life with more Anthropologie in it. 

A beautiful quilted duvet in mist-matched Indian fabrics on my bed perhaps? With the cutest porcelain drawer-handles to replace the old ones on my desk drawers? And the delicious smell of vanilla candles to compliment the equally vanilla perfume on my dressing table? And a beauteous mug full of fresh lemon and ginger tea on the desk, sitting beside the completely unique and individual hand-made leather-bound notebook, containing all the notes for my latest upcoming novel. And beside the gorgeous cup and beautiful notebook, a mismatching (yet so mismatching it matches) china plate that I made using the most stunning yet still practical of kitchen utensils (like a pink spatula, floral bowl, hand-carved wooden spoon) spread with a layer of butter from the pottery butter jar.

You get the picture. My life with Anthropologie in it would be look better, smell better, taste better, be better (and I would be an author on the side, FYI) -in the most fabulously earthy, boho hippy chic-meets-Betty-crocker type way. It's just...me...in a store.

Sadly, my wallet and pennies do not afford me the luxury of living in a home that looks as if it just happened to all fall together like that in the most mismatching and ear-worn of ways. (That Indian-material quilted duvet? Close to £300). If you could kit your home out in Anthropologie it would look effortlessly cool. Like even cooler than Monica's apartment in Friends (cos that was so at least 10 years ago...God I'm old.)

They also have clothes. And accesories. And fashion things. An amazing hat that I wanted. And the cutest little aardvark toy. See, all pointless things I don't need but that my life now feels imcomplete without. The clothes aren't quite so *me* but the homewares...ohyes.","3sMcKyE8SjrU3CKgOHs_EQ",4,"2012-02-22",3,"review",2

For example, I will pick up a cushion, and she will casually mention its value. I'll quickly replace it, blushing. ""Sorry,"" I say. ""I'm just... it's really pretty.""

She smiles - laughs actually - not a tinkling, vanishing laugh, but a proper laugh full of sparkle and fun. ""It's fine,"" she says, with a wink. But I've put the cushion back too straight. This is not a house of straightness. As she bends to re-skew it, back to the perfect angle, just so, I notice the way her dress falls. It's elegant. It's quirky. It's colourful. Oh, for a dress like that.

The coffee table is laden with enormous books: Berlin. Photography. Seasonal Pies. Spaces... Spaces? They're beautiful, and they don't look like they've ever been opened. They are there to be on the table. The table, likewise, is there to bear their unread weight. A candle in a tin, too, wide, with three wicks, which have never been lit; a fresh, fruity aroma hovers around it all the same.

I turn to comment on the beautiful smell but she's pulling on a patchwork apron over her beautiful dress. It messes up her hair a little bit, improves it somehow. ""Let's make a cake!"" she laughs - that laugh again - and pulls me out into the hall by my arm, starting to make for the kitchen. I wonder vaguely if she ought not to perhaps try making one of the Seasonal Pies instead. I nearly trip over a padded fabric doorstop on my way out, a paisley and polka-dot letter ""A"". Ah. Her name stops doors from closing. Of course.

""I'm - I'm sorry,"" I stammer, un-straightening the A, checking it for a mark where I've kicked it. No. Thank goodness. ""Actually, I - I have to be heading off again pretty soon."" I seem in danger of knocking everything, and yet there's so much room here. Spaces.

""But you never stay!"" she cries, with a playful pout. ""I've got these pecans to use up, you know...""

""No, really, sorry, I know, ha. Um."" I shrug. I'm trying now not to be standing on the rug. Has anyone ever stood on this rug? She probably stands slightly above it.

""Oh, spoilsport,"" she grins. ""Ok, off you go then. See you next time, Cressida!""

""Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye, Anthropologie.""

She waves to me from the door, an embroidered oven glove on her hand, as I walk out into the street, holding nothing in mine. Already I regret leaving - already I want to go back in - already I will visit her again. I turn to wave back, but the door has closed.","3sMcKyE8SjrU3CKgOHs_EQ",4,"2013-12-13",0,"review",2

This place caught my attention because I was driving by and there was a line!  You've got the standard flavors like vanilla and chocolate and then you've got flavors like root beer float, cake batter, cookies n' cream. What's really cool is that the flavors don't stay the same, almost every time I go in there are different flavors and they offer samples. 

Now, let's get to the toppings! There are several different sauces to choose from like caramel, hot fudge and butterscotch. Just a few of the toppings are brownie bites, cream cheese bites, reese's pieces, m & m's, frosted animal cookies, white chocolate, dark chocolate. There must be at least thirty different topping and they are all delicious! The shop itself is really nice too with comfortable chairs, natural lighting and the staff are helpful and polite.

The ONLY reason I didn't give this place five stars is the serving sizes. There is only huge and ginormous. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that this stuff is sold by weight so they encourage you to indulge. Usually, I do, and then I kick myself for putting to much in my cup. I've gotten pretty good at keeping tabs on how much I'm putting in it but those cups fill up fast and if your not careful you will dread that scale. My total usually tallies around $12 and that's for me and my son (don't just assume it was for me...). I wish they had a smaller cup for when I want to have just a taste and I won't have to worry about packing on the pounds on either scale....","-5fK4OgKir00PiuiGUIrAg",4,"2013-01-26",0,"review",0

"3861",5,"PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ","GkrmHhcm0L6CpEzWfy7vXw","¡Azúcar! Is this the only Cuban bakery in Las Vegas? The sign advertises that they are ""like Porto's,"" where I've never been, but I understand is the west coast standard for Cuban bakeries. I also know that Porto's is approximately the size of the entire island of Cuba, which Roly's certainly is not. I'm from south Florida, where there's a lot more variety and competition for this style of bakery, but I can report that I'm very pleased to have Roly's here in Vegas.

My first visit (I was driving east on Tropicana and made a right turn with no notice when I saw a sign that said ""cuban coffee""), I started with my standard order: cafe con leche and a guava-cheese turnover. The turnover was good, but did not fully meet my expectations (a bit dry? not enough cream cheese?), and I was disappointed when my cuban espresso with steamed milk was served unsweetened. In Florida, it is automatically assumed that you want sugar, or they will ask, already fully prepared to pour a full cup of sugar into the hot espresso. Only in Las Vegas, and a small Cuban cafe in Tucson, has my coffee left me wondering, where's my azúcar? Sure, I can sweeten it myself, but I don't enjoy the guilty feeling of dumping loads of sugar into my coffee cup. I could continue this rant, but instead I will note that I'm glad that I selected a slice of guava cake to take home, as it tasted fresh and moist and convinced me that Roly's deserved another visit.

The selections I tried on my second trip were better. I found a slice of the guava strudel more pleasing than the turnover with cream cheese from my first visit, and was introduced to the masareal de coco, two layers of dense, cookie-like cake sandwiched with a sweet coconut filling. I also love the tocinillo de cielo, a dense, yellow flan on top of a layer of sponge cake that helps soak up the caramel syrup. In addition to desserts, Roly's does have a menu of savory options. My husband has tried the traditional pressed sandwich, and said it was OK, but he doesn't have much Cuban sandwich experience for comparison. Having never sampled Cuban pizza, I ordered a veggie, which came topped with fresh spinach, onions, green bell peppers, cheese, and a sweet tomato sauce with a hint of cumin. The crust was more like a thick round of focaccia, so it was a very bready pizza. I'm glad to have tried it once, but probably would not order it again.

Prices are very fair at Roly's: many of the desserts are under $1. Breakfast specials are cheap and worth checking out. Empanadas and papa rellena (those little fried mashed potato balls with a ground beef filling that people seem to be so obsessed with) are also available. Plus, the place is usually packed with Cubans taking multiple boxes of pastries to go. You may wait a bit for counter service, but I think that's a good sign.","ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag",4,"2012-06-11",7,"review",6

After the experience, I probably should have. Not wanting to completely gorge myself, I ordered a eclair. It is massive. For $2.75, this large pastry is nothing to complain about. The thin shell had a good bite and did not go soggy due to the cream custard filling. The chocolate dip was generous, but not too sweet. As I was paying, I saw large trays of tres leches for $10.

First of all the Cuban bread wasn't authentic it was like the chewy bread Wal-Mart sells.  For those of you who've never had wonderful authentic Cuban bread, it has huge air pockets, is very very light in texture, with a crust that flakes almost like paper.

My second runner up would be the Tres Leches at Drago Sister's Bakery but their style is a bit more of a American version, sweeter, more dense, not as light.

One thing that caught my eye about this place is a sign that touts that they have the best Cuban sandwiches. When someone makes that sort of claim, I don't just take their word for it. I take this matter into my own hands.

Walking in, I saw their array of baked goods right away. Some being traditional items like cheesecakes, croissants, as well as their own selection of treats of Hispanic influence. Everything looked absolutely delicious, but I had to pass since I was there looking for a meaty lunch. Those sweet treats were put there to distract me when I had a sign to challenge.

The Cuban sandwich comes to about $8 + tax. It comes with the traditional works: ham, sliced pork, some pickles, swiss cheese, and mustard served between their own baked bread. In terms of flavor, the sandwich could have had more, especially with their sliced pork. It wasn't a bad sandwich, but it left me feeling indifferent. I kinda like my Cuban sandwich a bit more greasy and toasty. Sorry Roly's, but this was not the best Cuban sandwich. It was a bit to plain for my tastes. I have to admit that the thing was gigantic though.
*3/5 stars based on the sandwich alone

I decided to bump the overall rating to 4 stars due to how delicious everything else looked. They even had chorizo pizza and empanadas, which I definitely have to come back to try. Their cakes are very extensive and have so many other baked goods that's sure to satisfy the sweet tooth. I'll keep that in mind the next time that I drop by.","ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag",4,"2011-05-31",6,"review",4

I had the veggie omelet and the choritzo omelet.  Both were great with fresh ingredients.  But most impressive was the coffee.  They make a classic Cuban coffee with sugar, and they also make a great cafe con leche.

Interestingly, if you search for coffee houses in Las Vegas, almost all of them are some distance away from the strip.  I guess that is because the coffee houses serve people living here, not the tourists.  So this was a great find, although it will take a car to get there.  Highly recommended.

By the way, they also run a wedding cake business from the same bakery, but you can get many of the cakes by the slice - nice!","ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag",4,"2014-04-06",1,"review",0

Since Roly's Cuban bakery is near McCarran, we often stop here before heading to my mom's when I fly into town. So if you get on Tropicana leaving the airport, turn right.  In front of UNLV is an old Strip Mall with Roly's facing campus. It's not much to look at from the outside. And it's not particularly descript on the inside until you look at the display cases full of pastries and the most beautiful cakes.

The two women working inside didn't speak much English, but I speak enough Spanish that with the menu having pictures and prices, it's no problem. Just point and pay - money speaks in all languages. My brother order a Hamburger.  The burger took about 10 minutes, and it smelled and tasted different in a good way.  There are several different types of burgers, but the regular $6.99 burger is a quarter pound patty, with a Cuban style bun.  Chorizo is blended into the meat patty, and cooked chorizo is part of the  toppings, along with mayo, and red bell peppers, I would give the burger 4 stars. It would be great with an IPA (which Roly's doesn't sell)

Pastries were kind of sparse at 5 PM but some good ones were still around. I opted to get a slice of mango cake, with sweet mango topping a white cake and mango puree topping with cream between the layers.. I also got a slice of tiramisu, my favorite thing of all we ordered.  It had a strong cocoa smell from the cocoa powder topping, with whipped cream and white cake layers.  I also enjoyed the guava cheese strudel, but it was a bit heavy and too sweet.  I liked the coconut pastry with the dried sweet coconut paste inside the pastry.  The rolito pastry, rolled yellow cake with pastry, was decent but not as good as the other stuff.

Too bad we didn't taste the cakes. The ones we saw were beautiful, and if they tasted anything like they looked they would be perfect.  We don't plan to order any cakes soon, but this would definitely be a spot to order one.  There are table and chairs for those ordering their sandwiches and relaxing.","ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag",4,"2013-12-24",4,"review",4

Having recently ordered a cake for another event at another bakery and being pretty dissatisfied, I was really stressed about this cake order. Roly's came highly recommended from another Mommy friend of mine so I gave it a shot. 

The place isn't much to look at and I wouldn't describe the guy who took my cake order as super friendly but he listened to everything that I said. I had several photos of cakes from Pinterest and u was kind of combining them all to create the perfect cake for my little's perfect party. The guy was patient and took lots of notes. Then we got to flavors. They have tons to choose from and lots of fillings as well. We ordered a two tier cake (30 servings) so I got chocolate with raspberry filling for the top and Cuban cake (which he described as a very moist white cake) with Bavarian cream coconut filling. 

I braced myself for the cost: $172! This was extremely reasonable. So reasonable in fact that my neurotic brain started worrying about the quality of the cake. 

When I picked the cake up, it wasn't ready. We had about a 15 min wait which normally would not have bothered me but it was the morning of her party and I had tons to do so I was a little agitated. 

Any and all agitation immediately dissipated upon seeing the cake! It was PERFECT! Exactly what I asked for.  Driving the cake home was nerve wracking and next time I will definitely pay for delivery. 

The most important thing is this was also one of the best cakes I had ever tasted. Moist and cool with the perfect amount of evenly sweet frosting. I got several compliments from the parents and the kids devoured it!  My only regret was I didn't get to try the chocolate tier. I blinked and it was gone! 

I will absolutely be ordering again!","ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag",4,"2015-01-16",3,"review",2

The place is pretty clean. The bathrooms too! I don't  know why, but clean bathrooms, to me, are a good sign that their kitchens are also well kept. I could be wrong but whatever. The staff has all their hair in place which is also a good sign. The desserts looked extremely appetizing. I decided to buy their beef pastry, sausage pastry, senorita, meringue, and tres leches. 

The beef and sausage were okay. The senorita was good but I couldn't get myself to eat it all. The crust it had was a bit hard to get through with a fork. The filling was good but the lack of other flavors other than the vanilla made me get bored of it quickly. The meringue was good too. I don't think anyone can mess that up.  The tres leches on the other hand was awful! It was just cake and milk mush with whip cream on top. It was gross! I always though tres leches should be a little dense. Oh well.

Guava and Cheese Turnover
Cappucinno
Flan
Pan Con Croqueta - Ground Seasoned Ham Croquettes with Swiss Cheese Served on Toasted Bread

Located on East Tropicana Avenue and as such driven past thrice weekly en route to work it was largely an effect of location and ongoing intrigue that led me to Roly's Bakery on Saturday afternoon and opting for a small selection due to otherwise substantial eating plans my experience was fine, though certainly not without flaws.  Obviously a small space, and one not particularly easily identified from the street despite large billboards located down the street, it was just prior to 2:00pm that I entered the small Cuban bakery and with several folks seated and eating I took my time to peruse the options, a middle-age woman keeping a watchful eye on me until I was ready to go, my $10 order of one savory and three seats delivered to the table with a cup of water just five minutes thereafter.  Beginning first with the pork croquette sandwich, a pair of fried sticks filled with what I can best describe as 'pig puree' proving an acquired taste beneath tomatoes and Swiss cheese, I only ate one half before satisfying my curiosity and moving onward the guava-cream cheese pocket was indulged in similarly - a nice enough flavor, though most would find bottom of the wastebasket as I'd have simply preferred it more flaky and warm.  To this point largely underwhelmed it was onward to the meal's two best selections that I moved and although the 'cappucino' was two lovely bites of sponge cake rife with simple syrup it simply could not compare to the eggy custard flan, a world-class example with a lightly browned top and pockets of raisins amidst a sea of lightly sugared eggs.

Small, cozy, and pleasant in service Roly's is one of the few places where locals are able to indulge in Cuban baked goods, but with a limited selection and too much focus on 'everything to everyone' items like crème brûlée, cupcakes, and tiramisu I'd have rather see them focus on more esoteric specialties like Porto's in Los Angeles - the lack of several items, including the tres leches, in portions smaller than a full tray was particularly disappointing.","ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag",3,"2014-09-22",1,"review",0

"3901",2,"5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA","U-3ifL_Cq1LRzjb-OS0l2g","I first visited Roly's Bakery two weeks ago with my husband. We stopped in for a pastry and coffee to follow up lunch at Cuba Cafe. 

Confession: We had a full meal with appetizers, sides, entrees, dessert, AND coffee at Cuba Cafe but, upon realizing Roly's was just down the street and on the way home, we decided to turn our cheat meal into a cheat life. I'm not ashamed. 

Though I was unable to eat again until the next day, I'm both glad we visited and sad we didn't know about this place sooner. 

My husband and I are recent transplants from LA where Cuban bakeries are abundant (Porto's and Cafe Tropical being two popular go-to's). I mention this because most of my experience with Roly's is best explained through comparisons from what I already know.

We ordered a guava cheese pastry, otherwise known as a pastel de guayaba con queso, and two espressos. 

The coffee: It's very easy to percolate a pot of Cuban coffee at home but it's so refreshing to have it done for you on a much cooler industrial percolator.  Based on the cups used, Gavina is the grounds of choice here. Within minutes, two steaming cups were brought to our table and we were directed to the counter for our sweeteners. My Cuban husband was disappointed to not have his coffee made with the characteristic sugar slurry but, at the same time, having the option of using non-sugar sweetener was nice (sidenote: on our second visit today, we were asked if we wanted sugar already mixed in, which my husband enthusiastically accepted).

The pastry: We were served a pastry that was still warm and crusty. It was absolutely delicious. Here's where the comparison comes in: while the price point is higher at just a bit over $1 per pastry, it was more than generously filled with guava paste and cream cheese. The ratio was just about perfect, which I cannot often say about the pastries at Porto's.

A quick scan of the cases and menu showed two things: cuban crackers and bread that we'd been missing all this time as well as breakfast served all day. The latter was what brought us back today. 

There are four combos available: 

#1: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), and coffee for about $5

#4: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), marinated steak, pastry, and coffee for about $8 

To each combo, you can add ham, sausage, and other items for $1/each .

In addition, there are four omelette selections: western, spanish, veggie, and one other that escapes me. All come with a pastry and coffee. 

I ordered the #1 with fried eggs and added bacon. Now, at $1 extra for the bacon, I expected one or two small slices. What I got was THREE crispy thick slices. The eggs were fried perfectly to my liking. The toast? Well, what's there to complain about when you're given freshly buttered toasted Cuban bread?

My husband ordered the #3 with scrambled eggs and a guava pastry. First, it's clear the eggs used are real and not bagged. Second, my husband was thrilled to find that they're seasoned lightly with Sazon, a popular Latin seasoning blend that we use in his eggs at home. Now, the most important part. My husband loves croquettes but has learned not to expect much from any place that sells them. Today, that changed. He bit into his croquette expecting the usual mediocrity and, instead, his eyes lit up and he looked toward the kitchen said, ""Oh my god, MOM? ARE YOU IN THERE?"". I took a bite and can attest to the fact that these are the best croquettes I've had from an eatery.

Anyway, I am Dominican and I was born and raised in Miami. Many of my friends growing up are Cuban.  To this day, when I go home to Miami my dad goes to Riviera Bakery on 17th ave to get me an assortment of pastelitos. So, I consider myself an honorary Cuban pastry connoisseur.  With that said, I will say that Roly's is pretty good, for Vegas. 
I've had the pastelittos (pastries) - cheese, guava, guava with cheese and meat. All good, but not as flaky and yummy as I am used to. 
I've had the croquettes, and they are okay as well. 
I had a mango milkshake and a mamay milkshake and they were both good.  
Can't go wrong with a cafe con leche.  
So here's the deal.  If you're expecting authentic ""from back home"" stuff, then you're going to be disappointed.  But, if you just need a little fast of home to get you through the day, week or months, then you'll be okay.  They do a good job and trying to make everything truly as Cuban as possible and you have to give credit where it's due.  And if there are Cubans in there on a regular basis drinking coffee and eating sandwiches, then it's gotta have some authenticity to it.

I do usually choose B&N, but I think I liked the Borders experience better in this location. Firstly, it's a little bit easier to approach/find parking for than the B&N (when coming from 90, it's a quick right on Detroit, then left into the parking lot, as opposed to weaving in and out of Crocker Park ""streets""). It's right next to the movie theater and Spoon Me, two of the main reasons I have to visit Crocker Park (the other being Liquid Planet, but I think Spoon Me trumps that one as well).

Also, I like the layout of this Borders. They have a nice kids' section and a much larger parenting/education section than the Barnes and Noble (yes, I suppose since I'm a mom now, I have to take these things into consideration).

I was afraid that the arrival of Barnes and Noble 50 feet or so away from here would kill off Borders, but as of now, Borders is still alive and well. Maybe it's because the prices are cheaper? Finding a good deal at Barnes and Noble happens occurs just as often as passenger pigeon sightings...whereas Borders typically has some type of deal running, and if you're a Borders Rewards member, you can nearly ALWAYS find a discount coupon either via the web or their emails...and if you aren't able to find one, wait a few minutes and one will probably appear in your email! =)
(I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to be in Borders Rewards, considering that it's FREE to join...but hey, the money that isn't being saved on discounts goes into the economy, which seems like a good thing these days, right?)

THE UP-SIDE:  Books, CD's (for those without iPods!) and lot's of cards and stuff.  This place is pretty clean, efficient and friendly.  Best of all, they have a coffee shop in house where you can read all the books without paying for them!  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  Like a big, dumb, lumbering corporate dinosaur, this place has the nerve to still charge for the wireless internet.  WTF?!  You gotta be kidding me!  (If you're a smarty-smartster like me, you'll just grab the FREE wi-fi signal that wafts through from neighboring Bruegger's Bagels across the way!  Me loves to rip-off the man.)

In addition, this place attempts to push their ""Borders Rewards Cards"" with every purchase.  This isn't such a big deal, as most employees here will accept it when you say you don't want one.  However, there is one absolutely annoying Borders drone that works in the coffee shop area.  He will annoy you to no end, practically force-feeding the benefits down your throat.  I've told him I don't want one, that I visit the store every week, and that he has asked me over 10 times so far.  I told him, ""Please remember me and never ask again.""  He refused and said he will always ask.  He just doesn't care that he is annoying me and will basically always do so.

Whether you're a serious runner, just getting started, or a walker looking to change up your routine, Adventure Run is a great event. The best part about it, other than being completely FREE, is that it isn't a set course or distance so everyone, regardless of ability, can participate. You start off by going through a mini expo and trying out gear, tasting samples, or checking out various local races and you get to earn raffle tickets as you go along. Then, they drop a map and it's up to you to find as many of those checkpoints listed as possible in an hour to get even more raffle tickets. Fast runners can go the distance and get a great, fun workout, while walkers are still able to get to the closer checkpoints. At the end of the hour, everyone returns to Road Runner Sports for a huge raffle! The prizes never disappoint and always include a free pair of shoes for some winners! I also love that you can get delicious craft beer at this event for $1 a pint and that all goes to charity! Let's face it, what other point is there to running than having a cold beer at the end. I can't imagine a better way to spend an otherwise boring Thursday night! All the runners are so friendly and it's so easy to meet new people and make new friends! I always recommend it to people who are new in town and this is Phoenix; there's always someone new in town ;-)
My tip would be to register ahead of time to get an extra raffle ticket at check in. 
They also have this event at the Scottsdale store so that makes for 2 great Thursdays a month!","1tuAZhyLMJ7Non9Olsi4Iw",5,"2015-07-30",0,"review",0

They have a top-notch selection of scarves on display, including the popular Pashmina fabric. They also have the more-hippy, flowy scarves in every variety of colors and designs. I also appear to have a weakness for their jewelry. Most (or all?) is hand-crafted, and I feel like every time I buy a scarf, I come out with a pair of earrings to match. I'm super rough on my jewelry, and even though the earrings I've bought are handmade, they have stood the test of time, and the test of me tossing them into suitcases and pockets while traveling.

Although I personally seem to stick to the scarf and jewelry wall, they do have a ton of other items too, including summer dresses and soft fuzzy things made of alpaca fur. They do accept credit cards, but I think they prefer cash if you can, especially if you're just getting a small-cost item (and prices are really, REALLY reasonable, often with sales on a purchase of multiple scarves).

Paititi is a small-ish store a lot like some of the ones you'd find in the Strip District; maybe this is connected to them in some way and I just don't know? Anyway. Small or not, the items in here are adorable. Dresses, skirts, shorts, jewelery, scarves - all with that fantastic handmade feel to them that department store items just don't have. And everything in here is just so fun - there are bright colors, patterns and beads on almost all of the clothes. It's perfect for summer.

Well, almost. Personally I found the material a lot of the clothes were made from was a bit too heavy to wear during this time of year, but then, I get very hot very quickly. I also wish there were a few items that men could buy in here, just because if there were this would be a great affordable place to buy unique trinkets for guys as well as girls.

As it is, though, it's still a fantastic little shop, and I left yesterday with a new bright multi-colored bead bracelet (handmade in Peru) and a flowered scarf. I'll be back to check out the rings soon, I'm sure!","2GZfp6OWBoywQVvX8bS3Hg",4,"2013-05-23",1,"review",0

Pros:
Very good prices for Persian take out
Meat is ""naturally raised""

Cons:
The lamb shank could be better

I had a hankering for some Persian food and was on my way up Yonge Street to get some.  I passed by Urmia Market and decided to give it a go.  I'm glad I made the decision.  This place is very good for Persian take out.

The lady behind the counter was very nice.  It was my first time and she treated my like a regular.  She was very polite and made sure I got exactly what I wanted.

I got 2 Beef Koobideh and a lamb shank dinners.  Dinners come with rice, roasted tomatoes and a salad.  Beef was $6.99 and the lamb shank was $7.99.  These are great prices for Persian food, some of the best I've seen.  There's a place south of where I live that charges 14.99 for the same beef dinner.

The beef tasted great.  The store says all their meat is naturally raised with no chemicals or hormones.  I like that sound of that.  The lamb shank was a bit smaller than I'm used to getting.  It was OK, but I've had better.  Still doesn't take away from the place. 

All in all, this place is great if you have a craving for Persian food.  Prices are great and the food is good.  Can't go wrong there.  I'm definitely going back the next time I have a craving.","1AXbGcdRlG09cgvHNaIj7Q",4,"2013-07-30",0,"review",0

I got some chicken again and am now heating it up for brekkie.  The 'fat', which I decided to save was very soft, like room temperature butter and melted when I spread it over my cold rice.  This people, is what the naturally raised meat and fat does.  It was not grey and hard like the crap from Maple Sludge Farms.  It was as nature intended. This is actually healthy fat.
Once again, the guy at the meat counter is very knowledgeable and very friendly.  Smiling and willing to go out of his way so that you have the best grocery experience ever.  It is people like him that make me love shopping.
The shelves are packed with traditional Persian foods, so the experimental foodie will love it.
I got a chance to go to the deli on my visit. Can you say OMG!!!  This food was FANTASTIC.  And I am not exaggerating.  I had these balls, like Indian kofta, delicious.  And some walnut chicken.  They did NOT  skimp on the walnuts.  It was so friggin' good. The walnut oil oozing on top, so healthy, good for the brain.  OMG, these guys can cook.

My salad arrived exactly as I had ordered it, the ingredients were fresh, and the salsa flavorful.  My husband's veggie wrap was also very tasty and had fresh ingredients and a soft, high quality tortilla.  We sat on the patio and the waiter was quick in refilling our drinks and providing service.

The chef is an incredibly nice guy and brought us some complimentary ""granita"", which is an Italian shaved ice made with fruit juice and no additional sugars.  He explained that this dessert is made by freezing the mixture in a pan and scraping the pan with a fork every 15 minutes to create the light, fluffy shaved ice texture.

I bought their $5 for $9 Worth of Hot Pressed Wraps or Panini Sandwiches deal and made my way over, excited to give them a second try since the last time I'd been here, they were still rather new. 

The place was empty when I walked in. A waitress was standing there looking at me like I was a freaking alien, so I cheerily said ""Hi there!"" to HER. I said it to HER. She kept staring. I told her I'd gotten a Groupon Now deal as I went to sit at the bar. She nodded, but looked completely flustered and finally grabbed a menu for me and asked ""This is To Go?"" in a way that pushed me to say yes, even though I was expecting to eat there. She stood right in front of me while I was trying to figure out what to order while tapping her pen on the counter, making me feel rushed. 

I had planned on getting a panini, so I looked at the paninis (the menu has changed significantly since we'd been there) and quickly saw that NO panini was $9. They're either $10 or $11. uhhhhhh okay. So I looked through the wraps. They were all $6-8, so whatever. I'll lose my extra $1 in savings. No big deal, so I order an $8 wrap called Popeye something or other, trying not to think about how it seemed a little sneaky to offer a deal for something that forces you to pay more or save less once you get there.

The waitress puts my order in their system and I give her my phone with the Groupon code pulled up. She writes down the information and she hands me my phone back and I hold onto it for a little while until she walks away and then I hit the ""redeemed"" button. She came back from the kitchen area looking even more confused and flustered than before. She needed to look at the code again because it wasn't going in the system. I tell her that it can't be pulled up after it's been redeemed, but I can try? So I do and show her that the code is gone. She huffs and paces and taps her pen against the bar some more, making me feel really uncomfortable, until she finally goes to the back again and time passes. When she comes back, our conversation goes like this:

Waitress: ""Oh my boss figured out why it wasn't working."" 
Natalie G: ""Oh, okay that's good!"" 
W: ""It's because the Groupon is for a PANINI, not a wrap. When they put up the Groupon, it's not supposed to say wrap. So since you got a wrap, it's $8, not $9 like the Groupon says and that's for a panini"" 
NG: ""..............Come again?""
W: ""You have to pay $8 for the wrap"" 
NG:""I have to pay $8 on top of the $5 from the Groupon? There aren't even any paninis that cost $9. And the Groupon says wrap... I don't think I understand why I would be paying extra."" 
W: *huff huff pace pace tap tap pace huff*

I finally tell her I want to speak to her boss or manager or whoever is back there and so she disappears again. When she came back, she hands me my food and just offhandedly tells me that ""It was taken care of.""

YEAH IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF. Where is my apology? Where was the manager? Why is this even an issue? Does the waitress know customer service at all? Good luck, Mumbles. I don't know how you survived this long.","0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw",1,"2012-05-18",5,"review",2

We tried to squeeze the manager for his secrets.  He wouldn't divulge them all, but they do make their own sour mix which makes such a huge difference!! 

We ordered a caprese salad as a starter-- and then each had an entree.  I had a wrap and my husband ordered one of their panini's.  All of the items we had were fresh and delicious!!  They did a very unique take on what would normally be very traditional menu items.  Nothing over the top but simple- such as adding fresh dill & parsley to the caprese salad, which surprisingly turbo charged the flavors! 

The service was very attentive and friendly.  I enjoyed it so much I brought my friend here for lunch the next day.  We both ordered different items and they were equally as delicious as the day before.

From the outside it seems to be just another bar that serves sandwiches.  But these are not ordinary sandwiches.  The fresh paninis are just different enough to wake up your taste buds.  Try a Long Island Louie.  Better yet, check out the hot-pressed tortillas.  Think of it as a roll-up pressed into a panini oven and grilled, then sliced into quarters and served standing up like a sushi roll with a dipping sauce.  I had the Mumbles Crumbles with shaved beef, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and a blue cheese sauce.  Great!

And ask about dessert.  Don't be discouraged that there's nothing on the menu except granita.  The banana split was a delight.  I don't even like banana splits but was talked into it after being shown a picture.  It was not your usual gooey mess, but had a single banana sliced, covered with sugar, then broiled to caramelize it, topped with three  small scoops of ice cream, nuts, berries, brownie bites and pound cake bites.

The week before I took my Truck to Network alignment on Cave Creek Rd and was told they couldn't do the alignment because I had worn ball joints and would need new control arms and quoted me over $1400 to repair.

This is a no-frills, old school shop that has a bunch of vintage cars and hot rods getting restored.


Thanks Gary!

Edit 4/2/15 : I just brought my wife's car in which was pulling to the right and I thought it needed a wheel alignment.  I dropped it off on my way to lunch and he had it on the rack when I came back 30 mins later.  Gary said it didn't need to be aligned.  It was probably a tire issue and there was no charge!  He wouldn't even take $20 for his time. Honesty is hard to come by in the auto repair business these days and I refer anyone I can to Gary.","B8_Uwdw06IcdD6BQmW6XIw",5,"2014-04-10",1,"review",1

They wouldn't write the total price for each parts so we took the name of each parts home and called few places and OMG all the parts would only cost me $220 WOW !!!

Once you have placed your order, they tell you how much it costs and then leave as soon as you go to hand them the money. Every time, without fail.

1. I knew it was questionable when i brought in oil i purchased for them to change out. He said they don't do this, because they like to purchase it. In other words, he needed to mark up the price for the same oil.

2. He told me that our Shocks were blown out and said that we can't drive too far. Normally, when your shocks are blown out, your ride will be like a bouncing ball. I closely monitored my drive and i did not have a bumpy ride that indicated blown out shocks. I took it to two separate mechanics and they tested the car and said if the shocks were bad, the car would bounce up and down. 

Basically, the owner lied about the shocks to get me to pay to fix them. 

3. One of my light bulbs is going out. I looked up the model # to replace them and i went to autozone to purchase the ones for my car. The owner said that these are the wrong headlights and I needed a more expensive set. Now, mind you- the model's I had were based on Lexus' recommendation. 

He then said that it would cost over $300 dollars to change out the bulbs. The bulbs he recommend was about $80 bucks, which means over 200 of labor.

He emailed me the price estimate, broke down all pricing and even explained that they are a little higher priced with their tires than other major tire companies because they are a small shop. Since I needed both tires and brakes and was willing to pay for the convenience of having it all done in one visit - I went with them. Roger even drove me to work himself when I dropped off my car.

Somehow I had forgotten how last time I was there, a had left my car to get a flat repaired after working a night shift, and they even had me drive my car out of their garage while I was crazy tired.

This time they told me it'd be a few cents under $40 for the flat repair, and that it'd take about 30 mins. When I got there, I confirmed the price, and was told $40 + tax, yet the receipt they printed me said $50 less a few cents, which included $4 for hazardous material charges. They then gave me an estimate of 1hr. When leaving them my tired to repair it and was just about to head to work, I said ""so I'll be back in about an hour,"" when I was told it'd definitely take them over an hour.

Also while I was in the office, before being helped, the man at the front desk went to the garage, and started yelling at one of the mechanics. This gave me an unsettling feeling, thinking about the state of mind one of the mechanics who might be working on my car would be in, after being yelled at. 

Of course, before they were done, they tried to convince me to do all kinds of work I didn't need (they've done this every time I've gone there, so it didn't surprise me).

A few days after the repair, I check the tire pressure on all my tires, and realized that they WAY over-inflated the tire they repaired. 

While their actual flat repairs have been fairly decent, I don't see me returning to this location due to the way they treat their customers, plus $50 for a tire repair seems a bit much.

I made a phone call to Kal tire on Dundas and Bloor to inquire about how much calipers were. The lady was nice and told me to bring my van in. 
They checked out my braking system and said my calipers where fine and wasn't seized. They told me the problem was cheap brake pads. That wore out way to quickly. 
I never been so pissed. Active Green and Ross should be ashamed of themselves. In hindsight I should of listened to the reviews and left the first time when I felt they were being dishonest. I probably didn't need to get all that work done to my brakes the first time. All I needed was brake pads probably. 
I posted the picture of the receipt from active green and Ross and the receipt from Kal tires. I can't believe they tried to rip me off a second time. No wonder the place is always dead. Another note I want to make was the owner said to me while I was talking to him was he wasn't into the mechanic thing anymore because it was hard to keep up with the technology. That should of been a red flag. I guess that's what I deserve for being so stupid. 
I'll be writing to head office soon and see what they have to say.","4tVCyxktuJUFBRKbCTa3sA",1,"2015-08-30",0,"review",0

Once I got there, the truck was out front and prepared for pick up. Joey was very helpful and professional at check out. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was he missed to mark a large dent on the upper left corner on the exterior of the truck. I know things can get over looked (as I even over looked that dent), but it is his job to do so. I was just inconvenienced at the CA location since the dent wasn't marked on the damage report sheet. But after the CA location called Daniel to see if that  dent was mentioned on a previous rental, Daniel confirmed that it was. I was beyond relieved!

PROS: Lobsters glazed in Brown, Garlicy Sauce, King Crab Legs, Fresh Fruits, Good Desserts like Eclairs, Lemon Cake, Staff does an excellent job at re-filling empty food trays, Waiters were really attentive and friendly.

Most items were fair and average at best

CONS: Hawk/Camp out with the anxious, greedy patrons for Lobster re-fill, you have to time it right and make sure you're either 1st or 2nd in line, otherwise, you end up with nothing and could be the 1st for the next batch.

Now I have to state that even though my kids are into the buffet dining experience, I am not, but having said that, the place does offer a variety of dishes, all of my kids where equally happy with the selection that they had and everyone did get plenty.  If you are a person who likes seafood, they had plenty for you, shrimp, crab, mussels, other fish; one of my daughters loved the fact that there was even sushi.

We were especially partial to City Buffet since their promotional prices and coupons made their buffet a pretty good deal.  So on Thursday afternoon, I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who told me that they accepted ALL COMPETITORS' coupons as well as their own expired ones (as they advertised).  I also inquired about the pricing and was told that the pricing was still $13.99 for dinner on weekdays and $14.99 for the weekends.  I was also told that they offered take out service by the pound which was $5.99 per pound without seafood and $8.99 per pound for their seafood take-out.  
 
We got there and were extremely disappointed and angry:
* First of all, after we ate, we were told that they did not accept competitors' coupons, in direct contradiction to what the manager told me;
* Their crab legs, braised lobster dishes were very slow to be refilled.  All the other people there were grumbling about this too;
* They did not have the fried, cracked crab and the Dungeness crab as they advertised;
* And they raised the prices on Thursday nite. Why wasn't I told that when I called on Thursday afternoon?
* Further, they did not have a take-out option by the pound.  They charged me the full dinner price for a little container of food that I took for my other daughter who was at home.

I expected the prices to go up or the menu items to diminished since I suspected that their pricing and their menu offerings were ""introductory"" in nature, but the thing that pisses me off if the use of deception, lying, and false advertising.  The honest provider would publish new prices and new menus and would not give people false information over the phone.

I just drove by the place on my way in to work this morning and the big advertising banners are still up at the restaurant with the false pricing and false menu items.

Seriously underrated. I'm Chinese, so naturally, I love buffets. Still, I find most of the offerings in Arizona to be lackluster if not downright disgusting. In terms of seafood, the quality at Jen Buffet (or City Buffet, as it's called now) is fresher than even Pacific Buffet, specifically the sushi/sashimi and the shrimp. The grilled fish is also really fresh. There are less items than Pacific Buffet, but the quality is generally better. Here's the run-down of my experience.

Day of the Week: Saturday Night

People: Generally empty--there was one family speaking Cantonese seated near us, but mostly non-Asian diners

What I ate (at least, what I could remember):
Tuna and Salmon sashimi--fresh if small-portioned
Various sushi items--typical California roll, Philly roll, spicy tuna--fresh and tasty
Seaweed salad--too salty
Octopus--too salty
Mussels--chewy and fairly fresh
Oysters--clean oyster taste, though my brother complained his was bitter and had sand in it
Crayfish: Cantonese family swooped down on these as soon as they refilled the tray; did not get to try these
Clams: fresh and tasty!!!!!
Roast Beef: My piece was a bit tough/overdone in texture, but the flavor was good
Coconut Shrimp: The one Americanized Chinese dish I'll admit to actually liking--a bit soggy, but again, the flavor was good
Stuffed Chicken: surprisingly good; the outside was crispy and the inside with thick and juicy
teriyaki chicken: nice sweet/savory glaze and juicy, tender chicken inside
Mongo BBQ: light and not overly sauced
hot and sour: I have low tolerance for spiciness, so I thought it was a bit too spicy--my mom loved it
custard bun: small and delicate--possibly the BEST custard buns I've eaten at a Chinese buffet. Not soggy and not dry--the PERFECT dim-sum quality texture
banana ""pudding"" (in squares): silky smooth, cool, and delicious
unlabeled dessert that tasted like banana pudding with a tasty base of banana cake and bananas--it had the ""fake"" artificial banana flavor that my brother really enjoys
unlabeled soft-serve ""ice cream"" that I strongly suspect was actually frozen yogurt--not watery, but a bit icy as frozen yogurt often is. I loved it, though, being lactose-intolerant and all
cantaloupe-fresh!!!! It was actually FRESH!!!!! Oh, the joy of finding fresh fruit at a Chinese buffet

Missing food (that is, what Pacific Buffet has that this place doesn't)

-Crab legs: my mom said they used to have these, but Chinese families would grab 5-6 plates of crabs legs per person, in order to get their money's worth. Personally, I've always found crab legs at buffets to be bland and uninspired
-Pineapple RIce
-Red bean paste bun shaped like a peach
-More sashimi/sushi offerings
-frog legs
-hard scoop ice cream (green tea amongst other flavors)
-sweet dessert soup (with white fungus, gingko nuts, and dates/longan)
-BBQ pork buns (actually it might have been Phoenix Palace that used to have this way back when it was a buffet)

Price: $9.99+tax. Best deal EVER.

For the value, City Buffet has the freshest seafood in town. Almost everything was authentic (no overly sauced, greasy, ""spicy"" Americanized Chinese food here) and that might be the problem. Chinese people like authentic Chinese food, but they would never go to a buffet unless it had expensive items like crab legs and sashimi--otherwise, they can just prepare it at home. I'm afraid this hidden gem might close down or worse, descend to the depths of bad American Chinese. And there's far too much of that already.

Honestly, I'm not even a picky eater. Even though I am Chinese, I would not say I'm a Chinese food snob. I firmly believe that amazing Chinese food and dim sum can be found outside of San Francisco and yes, even in buffets. I love myself a good Chinese buffet and have been to much better ones.

BUT, this place is just bad

As a disclaimer, I do not eat seafood, so it was partly my fault for coming here. I can't comment on those dishes, but I can't imagine them being very good based on the other dishes

I started with noodle bowl station. This is really what convinced me to stay here since I love noodles. Well, the wonton were tiny and bland, while it seemed like they put three noodles in the bowl with a huge amount of broth. The beef stew noodle was also lacking in the amount of noodles and the noodles were still clumped up. The beef was so tough, and there were 7 or 8 pieces of anise in the bowl. Too much.

The mongolian grill was next as I figured, this will be better since I can choose my own stuff. NOPE. There was hardly any flavoring in the stirfry, the meats were awful quality, and no sauces really to flavor it all.

They have standard ""Chinese"" buffet fare like beef broccoli, spring rolls and orange chicken, in addition to some dim sum. The dim sum buns were hard and these dishes just tasted unappetizing. Blah. The spring roll was especially offensive. The only thing that I enjoyed were the fried wings, which I stuck to after discovering everything else was not good.

I got there late, so they were closing up shop, but I still had a great experience. My coffee shop benchmark is espresso. If a coffee shop can't get espresso right, then there is no hope that it can get anything else right. But Mama Java's gets espresso right! With just a splash of milk it tantalized my espresso loving taste buds with its smooth, sweet flavor. Like a good coffee shop there was lots of books, art, things to eat, places to sit, etc. This is a place I could spend hours on my laptop or a place to sit and talk philosophy.","2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ",5,"2009-11-13",0,"review",0

Last I checked Cream and Sugar are the coffee standards. Anyway, my problems lies in what has happened in the coffee world. I know there is the big debate between Sbux and smaller privately owned coffee shops. I am the first to admit that yes I prefer the smaller shops. Here is my problem.... 

Products take on the name as the product, i.e Band-aid, Levis, Q-tip, Duck Tape, ect. I think it is VERY rude to correct a customer when you know what they mean. This happened to me - I should have stated Medium however I forgot and said Grande - OMG shoot me now, the look of disgust and the correction. I wanted to take my $4 back and go to Sbux, at least they don't correct you and the customer is always right 

This become more evident when I was at Tuesday morning with a friend and I told her we should grab some coffee, but I actually had to tell her before we went in to not say Grande. She laughed her light hearted self and rolled with it. Really though, I have to tell a friend make sure you order correctly. 

Anyway, the last straw was yesterday when my boyfriend asked for cream in his ice coffee and they stared at him like it was crazy. I get wanting to be a liberal elitist, I think of my self as one sometimes. You just can't forget the customer is the business. If you know what they mean roll with it - DONT correct them. For $4 a cup of fancy coffee, I'll go to Crate and Barrell and buy a cappuccino maker and make my own. Yes Mama Java - this liberal elitist knows how to make her own.","2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ",3,"2010-10-09",3,"review",0

Even though I hadn't been in to MJ in a couple of months, Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte - incredible!  I felt so special (almost like a regular) when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte!  I did, and it was just as good as last time!

The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go, chat, etc... I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome.  Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit!  Looking forward to the next time...

Liked the vibe of the place....a few small tables and chairs and a couch...(or two?). There is free wi-fi available.....cool, cool, cool. 

They seem to sometimes have live music which if I have a night off may go back for. And they have some breakfast options available too - breakfast sandwiches and omelettes. Nothing too fancy or extravagant but good to know if I'm up early and want breakfast.

They have adorable little treats for only $.60 each (or 3 for $1.50). The chocolate covered macaroon was by far the best. Much like the elusive ""Bon Bon"" I feel like I've heard a lot about Macaroons in my life, while never actually tasting one, so I'm glad that changed with Mama Java.

Also, they have a toy sushi set that I really enjoyed. It was among the books. Next to the Mr. Potato Head. I think it was for children, but I'm easily amused so I had a fun time with it.

The only thing I would change is the $.50 surcharge for credit card transactions. But their macaroons are only $.60. I could probably scrounge up that kinda coin from my car any given day, so I'm not too worried about it.","2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ",4,"2009-09-28",7,"review",6

The coffee is good, the staff can be a bit forgetful but it's more amusing than annoying, it's comfortable, free wifi, lots of space for meetings/studying, lots of natural light (run trolls, run), and they now have a new section of gluten-free baked goods - to my knowledge the only in the area.

As for the credit card service charge - it's never been an issue for me.

Things I like:  Their coffee: That's important when going to a coffee house.  Accessibility: Lots of parking available.  Local Support:  They had multiply local artist work there to buy including their baked goods.

Things I would work on:  Ambiance: A real bummer of a place.  I just wanted to get my coffee and get the heck out.  It was an environment I wanted to sit and enjoy.  When you think coffee house, you think a place to meet friends, read, relax.  Not here.  It was too quiet, sterile, and the staff need a kick of caffeine themselves and maybe some knowledge on their goods their selling.

So we sat outside with our drinks, trying to ignore the thumping music and screaming from the bars nearby, until some guy lit up a cigarette right next to us and we had to migrate inside. Yeah, I'm one of 'those' nonsmokers. 

Then the weird vibes started. We parked at a recently vacated table and commenced reading/studying. I looked up and realized we were the only ones in there that didn't appear to be there for the musician, and everyone else in the place was completely silent. My fiance quietly murmured a few words to me at some point and it seemed like half the room turned around and glared at us. Cozy! Uh, this is a coffeeshop... right?

They have it all: hipster baristas, art on the walls, laid-back, slightly funky vibe. They even have the requisite kooky, befuddled, aging hippie behind the counter. He can't quite remember your order, but it's OK, because he's probably going to make you something delicious anyway, and he won't be a dick when you tell him it's the wrong thing.

They've also got that special brand of uppity-ness that you only find in coffeeshops -- you know, the kind that leads the baristas to post handwritten signs forbidding you from using your cell at the counter. Again, it's OK. After all, if you're on the phone while order, you are, in fact, a total fucking douche. 

The coffee's pretty tasty and the beans seem fresh, and they have a great setup for studying or working -- even tables in a little back nook that are perfect for groups. Free wifi, of course, and what looked to be a tasty small menu.

There are lots of tables, not enough outlets for your laptop and only ONE couch that I wouldn't even think about having drunk sex on.

What I meant was that it isn't a cozy place, rather cold, actually. I'm used to smaller coffee places where its warm from the steaming coffee cups, the closeness of people sitting around me and the many couches or arm chairs. I just need a hug at Mama Java's. 

There was only one guy at the counter when I was there and a long line but I don't have anything important to get to so I didn't mind the wait. I ordered a non-fat chai latte and it okay. Too sugary and strong spices.

The cafe is warm and inviting and we went straight to the eggs speciasl-better luck before 2pm on weekends, folks. The display case had danishes, muffins, bagels and an odd exhibit of bowls with raisin bran already poured into  just ready for milk, I suppose? I went for the potato knish, which was way over priced at 3.25 and since a sign on the sandwich board said ""For 50 cents add tomato or cucumber to your bagel...or whatever"", I added what were light pink unappealing tomato slices. I ordered a Cafe Mocha soy...and he charged me 50 cents for the soy (ERRRRRR). I wanted at least a fruit cup but there was only a bowl of some bananas, an apple and an orange for the fruit options. My total was like almost 8 bucks-I could have had a full breakfast and coffee at Wildflower Bakery for that amount! The cafe person warned me my knish may be too ""peppery"". My friend was so hungry she got the ham and cheese sandwich...made with american cheese. No fruit, chips, whatever and a coffee. We sat by the window and perused the lackluster books for browsing (1989 travel guides to Portugal, anyone?) although we did end up on the sofa laughing at Garfield books someone had left. 

The prices and quality of food were absurd and I hate being charged 50 cents for soy milk aka the lactose intolerance tax. And since most people are quiet doing work, I felt strange shootin' the shit like we may be annoying people. I don't think I will be back anytime soon.","2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ",2,"2007-02-05",4,"review",2

We were there around 5pm and there were only four other people there and two people behind the counter. They kind of left us alone until we were ready to order something, which I really liked. However, we shared a Frozen Mocha and it was just not very good.

I thought it tasted like like the coffee had been burnt, but my boyfriend said it was more likely they used a powder mix instead of real coffee. 

Also, it took them almost ten minutes to make this one drink with only 5 people in the entire place--four of which were at different tables talking and reading. 

The place itself looks cool and they have a bunch of books if you want to read one, but I didn't want to be there too long since we had somewhere else to be. The drink we got, which was only 16oz was  overpriced for $5.50. Cool and comfortable location, but as of right now Starbucks has better cold drinks, in my opinion. 

Maybe we'll go back another time and try something else.

"4090",2,"PhrYE1S_prUdf9KHi4basw","lpoFe1EYRnfBI8s4MKJDGQ","The short: It's all solidly good--the not-too-pricey coffee, the simple pastries, the breakfast sandwiches and knishes, the baristas, and the comfortable and mellow atmosphere when going solo or meeting a few friends. 

The long: Located on the southeast corner of Indian School and 36th St., in the strip mall between Tuesday Morning and Darwin's, MJ's is accessible and fairly easy to sign. The wall of windows lights the place up awesomely, and even at night, it doesn't turn into one of those dark, moody coffee joints. They find new artists to show art every couple of months or so, and it's usually pretty good. Their couple handfuls of small tables are easy to shift around if you're joining a group, but big groups might feel uncomfortable since it's not exactly huge. There's a nice quiet room around the back for people studying, but it's not enclosed, so on open mic nights or nights when there are featured performers, it's not so quiet. I love how clean they keep the place; when the baristas aren't working the counter, they're wiping down the windows, bussing tables, and restocking the coffee condiment bar. 

Speaking of the baristas, they're always friendly and attentive, good at showing off how to hustle (because when a coffee shop's busy, I feel better if baristas actually act like it), and totally interesting to look at--like fashion icons for today's college-aged generation, some with interesting piercings and tattoos, fashionable and stylish by not trendy clothes--seems like there's an appreciation for staff who are unique, interesting, and good workers. It's never uncomfortable, though--meaning, I never feel too old or unhip or out of place there. Customers truly run the gamut, from quiet middle-aged women catching up with each other, moms and/or dads with kids, suit-and-tie professionals stopping in for a cuppa, people hitting the wi-fi, and angsty artsy types having heated but civil political debates. 

I usually have the chai tea latte, but their coffee is always solid (I can attest to a decent café mocha), and I hear a lot of praise about their daily specials--every day, a different bean, special coffee, and iced tea. Prices are a little cheaper than Starbucks (I think it was $2.50 for the tasty mango lemon iced tea, and the larger specialty coffees can go up to $4.50), but the drinks are better. Pastries are always tasty and include a small selection of rugalah (buttery, flaky, chocolatey goodness--also available with raspberry or apple), a bigger selection of muffins, big and puffy croissants, bagels, cookies, brownies, rice krispie treats--certainly not a fully stocked French patisserie, but what they have is usually really good quality. They also serve one or two different quiches every day, potato knishes, breakfast sandwiches, and omelets.","2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ",4,"2009-01-15",2,"review",2

The inside of this place was very cute -- very funky coffeehouse.  

The guy working was a little odd -- very nice, but a little absent-minded.  I asked for an iced coffee and he got me hot coffee.  I told him I wanted it iced and he was like, ""oh yeah!  Right!""

I got my iced coffee with sugar free hazelnut syrup.  It was really delicious, and really pretty reasonably priced.  It was one of the better iced coffees I've had.  Not a Starbucks fan (it always tastes burnt), so I'm always on the lookout for new places.

Des amis de la famille m'ont donc suggéré d'essayer le YWCA et j'ai trouvé le parfait équilibre désiré.

Pour 40$ par nuit, j'ai eu droit à une chambre privée avec un lit simple, un petit bureau, une télé, un lavabo et internet gratuit. Ça n'était rien de luxueux, et puis c'était très petit. Vu que j'y restais plutôt pour dormir et y passer quelques heures à vérifier mes courriels et coordonner mes visites d'appart entres des entrevues, c'était l'endroit parfait.

L'arrangement des douches est le seul élément que je n'ai pas vraiment aimé. Les douches sont dans des cabines individuelles mais il n'y a pas vraiment d'espace pour se changer et s'essuyer à moins d'être en plein milieu de la place ou d'utiliser les cabines pour se changer qui séparées et du côté opposé de la salle.

 In terms of price, this is where I feel River Island truly begins to shine. By comparison, River Island is considerably cheaper than other clothing stores in Edinburgh such as USC, All Saints and Topman, as well as having reasonably regular sales throughout the season - where of course prices get slashed.


 Location-wise, it's great. Situated just on Prince's Street, it's within the hub of activity of Edinburgh's busiest shops.

He said he had to do what his boss said even though he is the one that is certified to do the inspections- NOT WILL.  Kudos for an honest person there even though the manager is a crook.  I made a complaint to Corporate and have had several conversations with someone 
from Corp.  They admitted Will was wrong and should not have done that!   

HOWEVER, Will is still the manager there so BEWARE!  

I was taken advantage of by  this business just so Will could sell some tires.  What does it say about the company that keeps someone like this on as an employee and especially as a manager!!???   
ANOTHER BEWARE- I went on Better Business Bureau  site to file a complaint.  You may want to read about this company on the BBB site before you think about doing business with them.","7CMmacH7B1OFC3ItVEu3KQ",1,"2014-05-08",3,"review",0

In Colorado, I always had one shop full of good ol' boys that would get the job done and that's all you needed. I've never could find that in Phoenix so far. That all changed today. My car wouldn't start this morning, so I had AAA tow it over to Jake's after seeing some of the reviews. I've sent other cars to other places in the area and they always rubbed me the wrong way whether it was the price, service or weird things like having dogs in the show room just running around (i'm allergic). I'm not a dog hater, but when I have to wait awhile for my car, it's either wait and get neck swelling or wait in 100 degree heat outside. Not for me..

That's why I called Jake's. From start to finish he took care of the whole situation and my car is running like a champ now. With all that said, he didn't charge the hell out of me when he could have knowing that I needed that car fixed that day. To me, that spoke volumes to what kind of guy he is and what kind of shop he runs. I've found my go-to guy in AZ and he deserves every dollar of the business i'll try to bring in from my neighbors, friends and family.

A hostelry that performs its role admirably, yet apparently has few pretensions towards fashion or changing tastes. As you descend the rickety stairs to the toilets there's something a bit dirty about the whole experience, with greasy graffiti adorning the walls. But if this is what you were looking for, an instant hit of gratification, you'll find few better examples.

The beers on offer are standard fare, with a guest ale or two on tap. During the festival at least there's a mixed clientele of young and old, but I'm sure The Ale House is welcoming enough at any time of year.","6ioGGhiSRG0T-Z7NvJ-sXA",3,"2013-08-03",0,"review",0

Accessed through unassuming doors at the back of the bar, the toilets are located in the bowels of the building. As you descend the treacherous stairs, you can feel the significant drop in temperature, as all hope and warmth is sucked from your world. The floor of this lower level is entirely taken up by a shallow puddle, caused by a faulty urinal on the wall. Looking for some form of sanctuary, you make your way to the singular cubicle. There is a roll of toilet paper perched upon the cistern. It is in an advanced state of decay. The door does not close, nor lock, and you are intruded upon by an aged, supremely intoxicated local, one of the denizens that haunts these catacombs.

The staff here are really friendly and always engage in conversation, which gives the place a homely atmosphere at times. As stated in previous reviews this is dfinately an old mans pub, so expect minimal fuss in terms of decor, grumpy old men (including myself in this, not old per say but definately getting grumpier and older :D ), resonable food and good prices for drinks. They have lots of pub style events happening through out the week, check their FB page. I really enjoyed the open mic night here a few weeks back.

""Yes, go!""

So went the general conversation at Kampong Ah Lee after our yelp get-together meal. All hailing from completely different parts of the city, we just wanted somewhere close that sold drink, and you can't get anywhere much closer than next door.

I have to admit I wouldn't have normally stopped in here, or gone out of my way to. It's an old man pub, which I think attracts mainly said old men and students. There were lots of students, huddled around tables eating lots of packets of chocolate biscuits with their pints. Awh, bless.

But the bar staff were friendly, easy going and didn't mind a crowd of us around the bar despite that there were ample free seats. The tv screens are obviously an appeal as almost every man I spoke to (Chris M, Jurgen D, Joe A, Andrew...I'm looking at you all!) got that distracted, distant-look of ""ooo shiney moving things on a flat screen"" look more than once.

There's a lot of old man boozer's on Nicholson Street. This was 8pm on a Tuesday evening. It was pleasant enough, I think mainly down to the company. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I didn't experience anything particularly terrible here. Although I didn't use the toilets or stay past 9pm...","6ioGGhiSRG0T-Z7NvJ-sXA",2,"2011-05-19",2,"review",2

I make no apologies for this, I have a soft spot for the ""old man pub"" it is a dying breed which for a reason I am about to explain rarely lets me down. Consider this; a certain type of ""Grumpy old man"" TM tends to value service, price and decent booze, these folk have a lifetime of drinking behind them (and given their natural anti-sociableness and the cheapness of drinking at home they are still choosing to come out) so if they think a place is ok then odds are it likely is.

The Ale House is a decent place either to get a beer/ale or a core (gin, vodka, rum and whisky) spirit. Sure it is no frills and I likely wouldn't want to eat here but they keep a decent array of spirits and actually know a bit about keeping ale.

McEwan's is not much to look at from the outside, nor is it that appealing inside either as the carpet is quite sticky and the chairs are full of stains.  

The saving grace of McEwan's is the open mic night they hold which is generally guaranteed to be a good night, with mostly good acts performing.

after being told we couldn't order food in hyde out (for reasons unknown to us as the cook was clearly making food in the kitchen) we headed to the next closest option and lucky for us it was this zizzi.  we we first came in the waiter that greeted us seemed a bit put out that there were eight of us for a table without reservations (although they were only moderately busy with empty tables available).  luckily for us the guy set a table anyway and we were shown to it with our drink orders taken by a lovely and friendly waitress.

i really have to compliment the waitress on her service for us.  she was lovely and polite and helpful the entire time, checking on us after the food arrived but not constantly being around or disappearing for long lengths of time.  after such poor service at hyde out i was really pleased that this girl was so attentive and friendly, well done to zizzi for hiring her!

the food was also very lovely.  we had an assortment of garlic breads to start, my favourite being the tomato with pesto although the garlic bread with cheese was also quite tasty.  i had a rustica pizza for my main with auberinge, rocket, olives, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms (which i'd subsituted for the peppers) drizzled with pesto.  it was awesome!! and the perfect thing to line my tummy for the drinks to come in the night ahead.  i also shared a really lovely sauvigon blanc that was fruity and fresh and so enjoyable :)

so yes a chain restuarant, but this place had good quality food and good service.    it's a bit of a shame that it's tucked away behind cargo but this didn't seem to stop people from finding it.  so well done zizzi for proving that chain restaurants can also provide a lovely and tasty meal.","HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw",4,"2013-01-27",1,"review",1

The location is the first aspect of this restaurant that is striking.  It is situated at the canal basin that marks the end of the Union Canal, which links Edinburgh to Falkirk.  This area was developed relatively recently, and befits the fashionable image that people would now associate with the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh.  The building that houses the restaurant is primarily glass in construction, and this affords diners a great view of the canal basin and the moored boats.

The food is particularly good.  Prices are comparable to its competitors, and the quality of the food is great.  I was there as part of a large group, and never at one point did I feel that anything was taking too long, or did I impatiently have to catch the eye of the waiting staff.  The kitchen feels like part of the restaurant, and if you're looking hard enough, you can actually see your meal coming together.

This is a great restaurant.  It's a shame that it doesn't get more attention, and I would recommend it as a great meal out along the same lines as Pizza Express.","HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw",4,"2010-07-01",1,"review",0

Food is good. Pretty wheat heavy. Pizza, pasta, garlic bread etc - luckily I'd just been out on a long ride so was feeling like I deserved it. 
I had some weird half calzone. It was good though! There is a lot of spice going on in their stuff sometimes though which I'm not 100% happy with. Sometimes it just seems to be a bit OTT.

It is owned by the same people as Pizza Express and Ask restaurants and offers reasonably priced Italian food. They often offer '2 for 1' meals to boost business which means it becomes great value (given most main courses are sub-£10 anyway). The pizzas are excellent and you can watch them being cooked in the wood fired oven in the restaurant. The pastas and risottos can be more hit and miss however with the focus on heavier sauces (it can be a bit much at lunchtime!). The menu changes regularly and there is a wide choice of types of pasta and a good selection of vege dishes.

The pizzas are cooked in the large oven at the back of the restaurant, and they are very good.

This place is packed full with so much crap you don't really know what to do with yourself.  The inside portion is rather uninteresting, with lots of stuff that looks like you could get it all on the Mexico border.  A lot of the stuff is unfortunately not unique as I saw lots and lots of multiples of things.  Outside however is a different story.  There is pottery for days and all sorts of iron work to keep your eyes entertained.  venture a little further and you will find an entire room full of Native American drums and a giant orange leg.  You really have to see that one to believe it.  Wander some more and you will see a metal version of pretty much every animal and plant you can think of.

DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD/EASY MADE MONEY HERE!!!! 

I stopped here on Thursday of last week for the first time. I was looking around for some photography props and had found an ok chair. The price was double if not triple what it should me. I mean it's a chair made out of pallets and they are charging $60 for it. Ridiculous. So I went inside and kindly asked if they negotiated prices and she said NO they are set. I said ok and thought no biggie. Because it was so dead I had asked her in a kind voice if it gets busy for her on the weekends and she said in the snottiest voice ""I don't know, I don't work the weekends"". She never stopped to speak with me or look me in the eye. So flipping rude.

We were driving up from Scottsdale specificly to go to the Town Dump. We were on vacation from Indianapolis and wanted to go there to see if we could find a gift / souvenier for the mom of a young girl that was vacationing with us. We were half way there when we called  to see what time they close. The woman on the phone said 6 pm.  We explained we were from out of town and were in route at the time  of the call and it looked like we would be arriving a few minutes before 6pm. We asked if we got there before 6pm, would we still be able to shop. The woman said no, because they had a contract with an alarm company which required them to set the alarm exactly at 6pm. ( I find this hard to believe.)

Since we were already half way there, we decided to see if maybe we could arrive fast enough for the woman to allow us the honor of shopping for junk in her store. We pulled into the lot at 10 till 6. I thought great, we can run thru the store real fast with Maddie to see if anything caught her eye. We jumped out of the car quickly and headed toward the door. The woman was outside and practically ran to beat us there. She grabbed the security gate and pulled it across the door shaking her head no. When I said , but it's 10 minutes before 6. She said in a snotty voice, ""it's 3 till and we have already set the code.""  Even telling her we drove from Scottsdale specifically to go there, it did not sway her.

In summary, I know my watch was not off. I know we had 10 minutes. I would have been ok with her saying we had to leave at 6 or a minute before. The bottom line is, she was cold, heartless, uncaring, self centered, uncompationate and I will never go there again.","3mUsON5MUIF3ciVLF0uLTA",1,"2012-07-28",3,"review",0

The variety is mind-boggling... rugs, mirrors, paintings, handmade furniture, dishes, sculptures/statues, farm equipment, and, as other reviewers said - junk. Prices seem reasonable, I guess - kind of hard to know if $600 is a steal or a rip-off for a life-size flying unicorn (see pics)... I mean, I'm not sure where I'd go to compare prices on something like that.

I wasn't looking for anything in particular, and that's the right attitude for this place - you never know what you're going to find. Thankfully I followed Eugene's advice and only took in the cash I was willing to spend - otherwise, in addition to the neat little end table / magazine rack I found, I definitely would have walked out with a super cool but totally unnecessary $200 iron monkey statue (see pics).

One last note - it's a big place, and a good portion of it is pretty much outdoors (some covered, but not air conditioned), so if you go during the summer months, I recommend going early, before it gets too hot - they open at 10am (7 days a week).

The banquet space was nicely decorated. We had apps and drinks in the lounge before dinner -- good nibblies. Dinner portions were on the small side but everything was quite tasty. Not 5-star dining but pretty good for hotel catering (on par with or better than weddings I've attended, for example). The servers were friendly and bilingual and kept things moving nicely.

Our room on the 4th floor with king-sized bed was quiet and comfortable. I turned off the heater/fan as it was a bit noisy during the night. 

A full breakfast was offered in the morning (included in the price of the room). There was a really wide selection including scrambled eggs, sausage and homefries and bake-your-own Belgian waffles, fresh fruit, cereal, porridge, toast, ... Not haute cuisine but much superior to the usual hotel brekkie of weak coffee and a packaged muffin.

We had a quick swim after breakfast in the indoor pool, which was clean but no showers -- bring a coverup or something to get back to your hotel room so you can change out of your wet swimsuit.

Definitely a comfy place to stay.","6m82IjcZEp72P-PVQijElA",4,"2013-12-21",1,"review",1

The location is good - right on the Trans-Canada Highway.  The Sources Rd exit has a bunch of restaurants just to the west (Del Friscos, Jack Astors, Elixer).  And there is a Tim Hortons just east on the service road.

But overall,it is easy to not notice this hotel amidst all of the auto-dealerships and industrial companies around.  It appears that 95% of their business is from the companies in the area.  The remaining 5% is the Canadian Lawn Bowlers Association that were there for the ""championships"" while I stayed there two nights - LOL. 

So maybe it's standard for Hampton Inn's in Canada, but this location has a bar.  Yes, in the BACK of the property, there is a bar that is best described as one of those temporary bars the bigger hotels wheel into a room during a show/convention.  On my first night here, I was the only person there.  Yes, the bartender and I had a conversation about how the lawn bowlers apparently don't like to drink before their tournaments.  On the 2nd night however, there they were - winners drinking with losers, talking about how the other threw that day and such.  I am sad to say 1) I didn't ask for autographs from the winning bowlers 2) I don't even know what ""lawn bowling"" is!

Back to the hotel... I have stayed in enough HI's to know this is better than most - besides the fact it has a bar.  There is a big indoor pool and a nice workout facility.  The breakfast waitstaff kept the tables cleaned as patrons dined on the typical HI fare PLUS BAKED BEANS.  You must be in Canada when they serve baked beans for breakfast, right??

Overall, I would give this property the rating I did because, as a Diamond HHonors member, I don't expect much.  Both my HHonors profile and my reservation I made through Hitlon's website asked for a higher-floor room near the elevator.  However, I was in room 125 for two nights.  That's right, I was on the 1st floor, across from the pool, overlooking the parking lot.  Meanwhile the professional lawn bowlers had the penthouse on the 4th floor.  I am not a snob, but I guarantee I was paying more CAD$ than them, plus I am Diamond for a twooney's sake.

Setup was lousy... took the laptop home and it was not working... wifi issue... I have a number of other electronics that use wi-fi in the house that had no issues, just this brand new laptop.  Took the laptop back to the store... the geeksquad looked at it said... it is your internet connection at home... you need to go home an reboot... so off I go back home reboot... and laptop wi-fi continues to drop (not work)... again next day took back to the store and was told we redo the setup... another day later, took the lap top hold and again.... worked better but not to the specifications as provided by the manufacturer... took the laptop back to the store... they replaced ... took the new laptop back home and ... laptop does not even connect via Ethernet and wi-if definitely does not connect... again took the laptop back...was offered to get another brand... yet there was no other brand that would be equivalent to what I was looking for... asked for full refund... was told no refund on the service which they were now telling me was $149.00.

Refused and argued for over 2 hours eventually the store clerk realized that I should not be charge $149.99 after I had to take pen to paper... they wanted to over charged me...

In reality they service they provided was not worth the $100 or $149.  I should have been provided full refund but was told they do not refund labour.   DO NOT SHOP HERE ... they will get you.

They kept trying thorought the last 2 weeks to sell me the extended warranty... so they knew there was problems with the laptop yet continued to sell to customers.... not reputable...

We went in and braced ourselves for the impossibility of finding any way to match the 6-1/2"" custom baseboard. We ended up meeting and explaining our situation to Eric Jordan, the owner. He was a very nice man and he took a look at the sample we brought in. Within a couple minutes he had found the correct moulding. He noted they didn't carry it in stock. But rather than offer to order it for us, he knew we needed to save time, so he sent us to a place where he thought they should have it in stock. He wrote the model number down for us, provided us directions to get to the place and even called ahead for us to make sure they did have it. We were almost in shock it was so easy.

My wine flights were good; keeping in mind that it is ""new"" wine.  Not being familiar, I was open to trying various types and the owner's suggestions were spot on.  If I lived closer, I would become a regular.","AUhevEi21Aqu-ISgaTcv6g",4,"2011-08-08",0,"review",0

I paid for a year plan because I was desperate, had no health coverage, and for my financial situation at the time it was cost effective... but it turned out to be the worst chiropractic experience I've ever had. It was like an assembly line, no privacy at all, not a relaxing or healing environment, the doctors weren't concerned about how you were feeling and were too busy talking to other people to listen to anything you had to say, and by the end of the year I was in more pain than when I first started coming here. What they continually told me was very depressing, indicated that I would never feel better and in fact might die an early death if I didn't follow their plan. In the end, I felt like they had done more damage to me physically and psychologically than anything else.

We got the fried oyster po boy and the 3 fried fish and shrimp plate. The food was really good, it came out piping hot and fresh out of the fryer. 
I have to say that their fried shrimp was AMAZING! They were really big (we were pretty impressed), perfectly cooked, cleaned and de-veined, crispy, great flavor! I now know where to come when I want fried shrimp. The shrimp was seriously so good and everyone should go try some! The price for the food was very reasonably priced. Yolanda came and checked on us to see how everything was. Their fish was battered with corn meal and was really good. Their portion size is really good, and they gave me an extra fish and shrimp I think because it was my first time there.

Located in a large strip mall right on the corner. Look for a place with a banner and several colorful posters of the food specials in each window.

They have Fish, Oysters, Shrimp, Chicken, Burgers, Philly Cheese Steaks and more. You can even order a Salad and load it up with with some of the proteins mentioned above. They also have several fried appetizers as well as some really good side dishes. The Coleslaw is really good and taste like my recipe. Great value and large portions.

Really like the Catfish and Shrimp. You can get them fried or grilled. The fried Oyster plate is also very tasty and a favorite of mine. You definitely have to try the Catfish, Shrimp or Oyster Po-Boys. Reminds me of what we used to get when we would stop at these tiny roadside shacks while traveling along the gulf coast in LA and MS.

Service is extremely friendly and you will see very quickly as you enter the restaurant. This also has to be one of the cleanest restaurants I have seen in a long time. It is nice to know they care about the customers and a big reason for my high rating. ENJOY!

My wife had the philly steak sub. It was so big that she only ate half and will save the other half for later. It came with onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and mayo. It was very good. The fries that came with it were cooked perfectly and very good. The prices are good too. This will be a regular place for us.","5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw",5,"2013-06-18",2,"review",3

I went online and found a special for Pure Radiance and thought I would give this place a try had never been there before. I made an appointment, which was very easy, and received a confirmation text 2 days prior to my appointment. Since this was my first time I was a bit nervous, I walked in, met Trina and prepared myself for what was about to come (eek)! 
Trina came in and explained to me the process as well as tried to lighten the mood with a few laughs. Trina was extremely professional with a delicate touch (super important). The room was clean and comfortable. Not going to lie, initially it was a bit uncomfortable. However the more Trina and I talked, it was like we had been friends forever. She takes pride in her work and wants every patient to feel amazing after seeing her. I literally changed everything, I stopped shaving, I stopped plucking....what I do now is relax when I shower, not worry about shaving every day or every other day. I have been seeing Trina for the last 3 months and I will continue to go to Pure Radiance because of the quality of work and how personable Trina is.","6XYB5DcwVEUd-Envna8s3g",5,"2015-07-22",0,"review",0

Feeling that it was a big-name high street department store that could be a bit outdated and geared towards an older crowd, I only decided to try BHS when I was lured by a great Groupon deal. The deal was actually for online purchases with BHS. After the Groupon code didn't work after several tries on the last night of the deal, I was forced to have to go through the customer service team to resolve the issue. They said I should purchase the items I wanted but could not get any sale prices, which seemed very cheap and cheaky, too, since the sales would have been applied if their code had worked in their system as it was supposed to. I visited the store on Princes St several times to check out and try on clothes but they all just seemed to odd, dowdy, or frumpy. I ended up deciding on getting some basic tights and some leather gloves as a last resort since I didn't see anything else that interested me. After ordering them online and being told they were in stock, the gloves weren't in stock a week later when hey decided to fill my order. I visited the store to pick up the tights and noticed that, low and behold, there were hundreds of leather gloves even though they were supposedly out of stock. I reordered with a different size and then it worked. When I picked them up, the ones I was given weren't looking in top shape so I found better ones and had them switched out. I am still waiting to be refunded the money for these things I was told I'd be refunded for and had spent way too much time on trying to fulfill the orders and get my money back. Staff haven't been very friendly either in store or online and the phone number listed on the bottom of their emails doesn't work, nor did the number I found online. I don't think they provide a very good service or very good products and I won't be shopping here again.","1rfRNfPT-uocY2XfdBO8SQ",1,"2013-01-30",2,"review",0

I find BHS so boring and stuck in 1990. I guess that is why Sir Phil has started selling some of the premises off to Primark knowing he can't compete with the cheap prices. However this BHS has improved recently by the addition of other Arcadia outlets such as Dorothy Perkins, Burtons and Wallis. I don't shop in these outlets buy my mam does and this makes her happy, so I think it is a good thing.

I popped in today to use the loo and it was a depressing sight to see. 2 of the escalators were broken and were littered with sweet wrappers and the lift had a sign next to it that said ""Lift permanently out of order. We do not have the money required to repair it, so please ask a member of our team to escort you to the goods lift.""

The restaurant was even worse. All the tables and chairs were packed away, the food counter was empty and there were no staff anywhere. I expect that floor was only open because the toilets were there. The toilet still had the sign that said it was locked but at the top of the stairs, the lock had been yanked off and I could easily push the door open. On the restaurant level, the sign said ""BHS Restaurant currently closed. Please use BHS Café on the upper sales floor."" 

While the shop hasn't improved, (in fact, it has tumbled even more than before) I just feel really bad for them. They have thousands of employees and they will all be made redundant because of the likes of Primark, New Look and Zara. Even Marks & Sparks has been involved in the destruction of BHS. I mean, it is not a nice place to be but I think we should let BHS have their space on the high street for a little while longer.

Kensington Market is a great neighborhood with a lot to offer, and is in a great location, so if you're looking for a good time and to be able to explore a lot of the city, it's perfect. 

However, the building itself isn't very well maintained. The community kitchen was usually a mess - mostly because of other guests leaving their food around haphazardly, but also because the A/C unit and fridge regularly leaked everywhere. The washrooms and showers are separated, so there's some privacy but as there's only a couple per floor sharing can be a challenge. They separate the women's dorms, and for the most part safety isn't an issue when it comes to other guests. A lot of the rooms facing the outside of the building have small balconies, but leave the sliding glass doors open at your own risk. It's so hot in the summer that you'll be tempted to shut only the screen door, but there are holes in many of the screens and one night I woke up to find I was sharing my bed with a raccoon.

Aside from the GREAT LOCATION of this hostel, everything else was simply vanilla.

Contrary to its name this hostel is not limited to college students, but a marketing ploy to attract the shoe-string budget traveller and also indicate the layout to expect. With this philosophy, you definitely get what you pay for, which is not much.

Check-in was simple and the receptionist was pleasant. There I was informed of the function, layout and offers provided to all guests. It consists of one fairly large kitchen with two fridges, one media room with one flat screen tv with two couches and two tables. Very basic and not very warm and welcoming.

The four-bed mixed dorm I was booked in was pretty small. One locker for each bed and nowhere to sit other than your bed. One nice thing about the room however was that it had a small porch with a nice view of the city skyline. The washrooms are identical to that of a college dorm - one separate room for toliet and sink, and another room with two showers and two sinks. I'm almost certain that layout applies to all floors within the hostel.


Though some may consider this hostel a bit shady, my dorm mates and other guests I encountered and interacted with were all amazing people in their own right, so the opportunity to enrich your stay with people and stories money can't buy are there for the taking.

The staff was cheerful and a pleasure to work with. I got in late (8:45ish) and had warned them ahead of time and it was just fine. The room was a bit small but had HUGE in-room lockers. I've stayed in a bunch of hostels before and this was the first one with lockers so big I could fit my daypack, my check-in size travel backpack and some souvenirs. Unfortunately the beds creaked a lot so my sleep was less than ideal. The bunk beds also didn't seem particularly stable as I was climbing up either. The showers didn't have a changing area so it was just awkward to change in a wet shower environment. BUT I found everything to be rather clean. No insects or anything, unlike the reviews I had seen at hostelworld.

Pretty basic breakfast. Toast with jam, peanut butter and Nutella and cereal. Coffee and milk available. Full kitchen. Plenty of seats and a flat-screen TV. One of the better hostels I've stayed at in terms of wifi. 

Otherwise, everything was pretty tidy. I stayed three days and felt just fine, but apparently the neighborhood can be a little shady. The morning I left, the TV in the lobby had a ticker saying a man was stabbed at a bar near College/Augusta...and I was like, ""wait a second, this hostel is at College/Augusta...at least I'm leaving today?!""

The average people seemed to be drifters who would definitely steal from us. While we were in our room one morning a guy literally walked into our room, checked out what we had then left. He was going to steal at that moment if we weren't in the room.
The beds were covered in hair, the bunks seemed unstable and creaked a lot. None of us showered all weekend because the showers were covered in slime as if they hadn't been cleaned in 15 years and one had the shower head broken off. There was no ac.
The most disconcerting and negative review worthy aspect was on our second day. The first night there was a double homicide at an illegal underground club twenty feet away. We wanted a refund since we didn't know the area and felt unsafe. The manager was extremely rude over the phone and wouldn't let us refund the days we hadn't even stayed for yet.

I called and left 2 messages on Saturday to confirm when it would be delivered. No one returned my call. 

I called again on Monday and said I called twice on Saturday about the delivery date and no one returned my call. The woman said that someone else would call me right back to confirm. No one did.

As for the price range, after several days of comparison shopping I would say for the quality of the furniture, you can't beat the price or service at Statement Furnishing.  If I could have I would've rated their prices somewhere between moderate and pricey, but I firmly believe you get what you pay for. We are very happy with our purchases at Statement and will stop in from time to time to see what new shipment has come in.","HQ-JuSquwiI1RrZPCjyUIQ",5,"2014-08-04",6,"review",1

Upon delivery of our bed frame, the delivery guys knocked a good chunk of paint off of our front door frame.  They immediately owned up to it, so it was not like they were trying to hide it or anything.  However, that was the first annoyance.  It turns out, the wrong bed frame size was ordered, and we had moved our work schedule around to accommodate the delivery of our bed frame on one day and the delivery of our air mattress the very next day.  Now the guys from sleep number can't put together our bed since we have the wrong frame.  We will have to wait for Statement Furnishings to order the correct bed frame, send people out to dismantle the delivered bed frame (while risking further damage to our home), and then have the Sleep Number people come back to assembly our bed.

Very quiet on a Sunday night which could be off putting but we received a warm greeting and so we got comfortable. 
The menu seemed just right- standard Thai fare with some nice pictures and clever descriptions-- we were drawn to several dishes. We had the crispy spring rolls and mango salad for starters. Then we shared the pad Thai (very good- my friend who was craving it after years away in Italy declared)- light and well flavoured, not heavy or gummy. Also had a very flavourful red curry chicken. Just coconutty enough and quite spicy!  Cashew chicken and ginger beef (not crispy if that's maybe what you are expecting) rounded out the dishes and a big bowl of rice for the table. We were 3 people and had very few leftovers bc everything was so tasty. 
And the service was lovely. Attentive (lots of water refills) but not intrusive.

I went with relatives for dinner and upon arrival, it was empty. Usually that's not a good thing to walk into (and it was a bit daunting), but it was understandable as the location of restaurant was really obscure.

Besides the lack of diners, although I did noticed there were people coming in to pick up food later on, I enjoyed my time there. 

It's a small, nicely designed restaurant. Modern and clean looking. The plating of the meals were great too. The server was also very helpful.

The food was tasty. I found there wasn't anything really special about the Pad Thai though, but that's just me I am and I am in no way a Thai expert, but I loved the pineapple fried rice, Green Curry  and coconut soup (and I generally dislike coconut). As for the portion size, I wouldn't say it was huge but average size for the price.

I might not have found this place without a tip from a coworker that lives in the area, and it turns out another coworkers brother owns it! So with those two recommendations, and a date at the Queensway VIP, it was an easy choice. 

The place is small, with two booths and a few tables. Based on the number of people coming in for takeout, I imagine that's a popular aspect of the place. 

We started with two apps, the fresh rolls and chicken crispy spring rolls. Both were delicious and fortunately the fresh rolls came out super quickly because I was starving! So starving that when the spring rolls came out I forgot to take a picture. Whoops. I then tasted three of the entrees, my own was the beef pad sew which was AWESOME - not light on the beef at all and the cut of meat was a higher quality than I was expecting. Yum! I also tried the curried up pad Thai and Tom yum noodles. Both were excellent! 

We were lucky enough to enjoy a banana fritter on the house which was also excellent! 

One more about the place is that there's no liquor license, which was sad because I wanted a beer! That's probably due to the takeout nature of the restaurant, and I survived. Lucky they serve alcohol at the movies. 

I could definitely see myself coming back the next time I'm in the area!","-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q",4,"2014-03-17",3,"review",1

Firstly, I will say that as a small business owner myself, service to the customer and making sure the customer leaves your business happy is paramount and unfortunately, neither the food or the business ethic has left a good taste in my mouth.

As Mangosteens is new and very close to my home, I ordered their Famous Pad Thai some Spring Rolls and Mango Sticky Rice through Orderit.ca. As a lover of spicy foods, I added a comment for it to be hot and spicy just out of past experience with every other Thai restaurant I have eaten at. Well ... I am not about to blame Mango for the 35 dollar price tag to get this single order 2 minutes down the road to my house .. BUT .. The next few hours proved to be an heated experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. 2 Litres of water didn't even get me through half the Pad Thai. It was fine with my friends to laugh at my attempts to eat this Noodle INFERNO but I had to stop. I don't need to expand on the extreme pains keeping me up from 4 am to 6:30 that night.

The next day I wrote to their website and after no reply I went to their restaurant and simply asked them to give me another Pad Thai without the ridiculous heat. They said they couldn't but they would have the Manager call me. .. They didn't call. 

I have just got home after a return trip to Mangos and after a lengthy chat with the Manager that included some drivel about ""Racial Profiling"" when I mentioned I never had such heat in a dish from other establishments, their reply was that restaurants would tone down the heat for people like myself. LOL .. OK ... So when you deliver to strangers via take out, you turn the heat back up? I asked myself. .. Here was someone willing to give their restaurant another chance to redeem themselves and I'm in a verbal volley over a 12 dollar dish!

My theory after they offered me 50% off, was to waive them of my business and to vent a little here. I'm sure their food might be very good but there is a Thai restaurant across the street. If just one person reads this and agrees that for the sake of future business with a customer is to make them happy rather then bicker about semantics then that is a 12 dollar expense they should have bared.

"4359",3,"-hUgrj7Lzir3yLUYrMYQ4g","5m6eGXu6ULg1778Rl02jsg","So I decided to go here after seeing that it was a new place that opened up around the area.  Based on the success of most of the west-indie places around the area I thought that it couldn't be bad at all right?

When you go inside, you're not really sure what the deal is.  It's half cafe, half bar.  On one end you have a cafe with cakes and cafe tables; on the other end you have a stage for a band and a pool table.  Weird.

Oh, did I mention that the place is also filthy?  I'm not really a big stickler for a really clean restaurant or sparkling floors but a pair of spring rolls and some napkins underneath my feat is going a bit far.  Maybe that was the appetizer?

To give it to them, a 5.99 daily special is pretty enticing, that's what I ordered.  It was a plate of jerk chicken with coleslaw and rice & peas.  It also came with a soft drink of your choice.  It was a pretty good deal in my mind.

The chicken was dry and not really flavourful... I'd almost put it on par with chicken from metro that had been sitting out for a while.  That's about what it tasted like.  Same thing with the rice and peas.  Not exactly the best thing in the world; in fact, far from it.

Being in a plaza with pretty strong contenders, this place isn't going to win anyone over at this rate.  If you want to have some jamaican food, drive 2 minutes down the block and you'll get something way better.","AeIO-BNccGmNpikIj95Dig",1,"2011-05-12",3,"review",2

The place was easy enough to find considering I'd never been there before, and the service was decent.  Not overly friendly, but I was acknowledged.
Walking in I noticed how different this place was set up to other restaurants, as they had a little cafe-type area to the left, and a pool table/stage in front/to the right.  The whole place was very bright and clean, and had music playing softly in the background.  I didn't realize until I was leaving that it was gospel music; which in hindsight makes sense considering the restaurant name.

I ordered the large jerk entree, chicken fingers and fries, and the slushie special.  The slushie was a pina colada flavour, about 16oz for $1.00, and it tasted AMAZING.  After finishing it, I wished I had gotten another for myself before leaving the store.  The chicken fingers and fries to be honest, were horrible.  They tasted worse than something I would have ruined at home.  The chicken was the same kind as nuggets from a slimy fast food chain or low-cost frozen nuggets, and the fries were unseasoned.  For $7.99, I was extremely unimpressed. 
The jerk entree my boyfriend ordered looked fantastic.  It was a huge portion (4 hefty sized legs) tons of rice and peas, with a spicy coleslaw.  I tried some of his meal, and while the jerk was too spicy for my taste everything was cooked wonderfully.  His $8.99 was hands-down worth the price, and made my meal seem worse by comparison.  He was able to eat his portion for three separate meals (lunch, dinner, lunch the following day).  My meal,  I tried eating what was left for lunch the following day, and I got about 4-bites in before I started feeling extremely sick.

Overall I would definitely go back to this place, but I would steer clear of the ""American"" dishes, as I feel the love and attention is more placed into the Caribbean-style dishes.
Also: if you are sensitive to spicy food, avoid the jerk and go for the fried chicken instead.  I assume it would be just as nicely cooked, only without the spice ;-)","AeIO-BNccGmNpikIj95Dig",4,"2013-08-22",2,"review",0

Very nice place and location with plenty of parking. The menu seemed endless and yet some of the things were odd to us. Not sure where they derived their version of Mexican food from but whatever, might as well try it. Popcorn as a starter instead of chips and salsa? Um, ok. Never seen that before. I tried the fajitas and they were served and tasted like every other Mexican place I've eaten. Family had the loaded nachos and complained about the soggy chips within. Someone needs to remember to NOT pour runny salsa over tortilla chips if serving as ""nachos"". Other than that, the pricing was fair and comparable to other places. Not my favorite but I'd probably go back.
Our server, Eden, was awesome and had a thick Scottish accent. Very nice and affable but I literally had to ask her to slow down when speaking because of the loud atmosphere in the restaurant.

I had a beef burger with chips and when it came, it occupied a very small portion of the plate and the burger was clearly frozen. The chips were oven chips, obviously. The chips had far too much seasoning on them for my liking and were too herby.

It was a very hot day when we visited and the AC wasn't working, the restaurant was packed and since there is little lighting in the place, it felt quite claustrophobic, as if we were being packed into the place like sardines in a can.

The only good thing about the restaurant was its clean toilet facilities!

The burger was pretty pricey as well. I think it was £11.95! I could have gone next door to Five Guys and gotten the same thing but at a cheaper price and a larger portion. I don't think I will be returning to Chiquito.","4aFAN5aS0Y873KNhBlkAvQ",2,"2016-07-09",1,"review",0

It's kind of tucked away, so it'd be easy to walk right by and not notice it at all, but its worth stopping for a bite to eat if you want something ""healthy"". Beware: this is not the place to go if you're in a rush, unless you pick up one of the ready to go meals that are in the fridge. They tend to take their time making things (all wraps and sandwiches go in the panini press, which adds to the wait time) but they make it fresh in front of you. It's a trade off I suppose!

While not everything on their menu classifies as ""healthy"" (an 800 calorie wrap for one meal doesn't really work for me) I've gone to both locations numerous times, for breakfast and lunch and have had generally pleasant experiences every time. 

If you want a quick cheap breakfast they  have a number of ""toonie"" options in the morning, including a grilled cheese. But beware - I got one of these so called $2 breakfasts and by the time I was done, it cost me $5 - but that's because I added bacon and tomato and they never told me how much extra it was (given, I could barely understand the girl but that's my own fault for not clarifying). If you want to pay a toonie, stick with the basics. I'll add that I don't eat a lot for breakfast usually and not eating breakfast at home is rare, so the small grilled cheese sandwich (plain the second time) was enough to get me through the morning til lunch but my male coworker, who values quantity, complained about how small it was. The full blown grilled cheese with bacon and tomato WAS a great option for the ""feeling iffy morning-after-a-night-of-drinking "".

The veggie wrap is rather nice - for something without meat in it, its a filling but light-feeling meal. Also, not too much sauce or stuffing, just the right amount. The Turkey Bacon club is yummy but its also rather large. I have a hard time finishing the entire sandwich and usually someone at work finishes the other half for me.

For a place that claims to be healthy, they've only recently added nutritional information to their website and I was a bit put off by some of the values they had for my favourite meals. However, that being said,  you can eat at Fit For Life without having that guilty ""I just ate McDonalds"" feeling and feel full and satisfied at the same time.","7K_yGsP6CVy1-hUpQvnQRg",3,"2012-02-23",0,"review",0

We got a tex-mex steak burrito, a veggie burrito, some sweet potato bites (with an amazing sauce), and we actually got 2 extra burritoes because we weren't how sure how big they'd be.

They are HUGE.  I can't really describe the size without it falling into weird places, but they are about six inches long, 2 inches around, and FULLY packed.  I can't believe how little they charge, because these are good.  The steak is really lean and tasty (I tried a bite), and the veggie ones are basically solid packed with totally fresh food - and I would guess that not even 1/3 of the filling is rice.  WOW!  Lots of corn.  We are definitely saving these for tomorrow's dinner, because we can't even THINK of eating anything let alone another whole burrito.

If you order online, you are taken to a website called foodler.com. You place your order just like you would order a book on amazon.com, and you get a total and everything. They even calculate a tip for you (15 or 20 percent) that you can put on the card, send you an email confirmation, and even estimate a delivery time.

The food came ten minutes early. Pretty nice. 

Was it good? 

Oh my my, oh hell yes, got to put on your party dress! Or um...pants if you're um...not that there's anything wrong with, I mean, Roddy Piper wore a kilt...

While they've embraced the future in terms of placing orders, they get medieval when it comes to food prep.

Stone oven folks. That's what they say anyway, and I'm inclined to believe 'em since this was crispy and chewy where it needed to be with a strong mozzarella blend, a nicely sweet 'n somewhat chunky sauce, and those uncanned mushrooms that get burnt when the pie comes out. 

The Aprimo Steak has it all and as a result is magnificently sloppy. If you ate it standing up you'd be doing the Philly Stoop, and you wouldn't care who was staring since what you're eating would be too good to allow for an awareness of your surroundings. 

""Mozzarella & provolone, mushrooms,
onions, green peppers, hot peppers, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes
& Italian dressing,"" they sez. 

What is it with mayo on steak hoagies these days around Pittsburgh, and why didn't people start doing this ten years ago? It's not the greatest steak hoagie ever, but it doesn't back down at all from any challenger.

The Italian Hoagie was rather good too. The bread on both sandwiches wasn't baked so much that it gets rock-like. It was toasted just enough to maintain pliancy and didn't skimp on the meat at all. 

How many years has it been since we got delivery from anywhere in Mt. Oliver? Jeez. They have something to boast of now.","9HD224rVyahrfg9SNe5SVg",4,"2010-07-24",5,"review",4

They do tack on a $2.00 delivery fee which many other places do not charge. The selection is pretty standard for the area. Most of the pizza joints in 15210 are pretty much the same. This place is a step or two below the rest, unfortunately.

We got a medium pepperoni pizza and a small capiccola hoagie. The hoagie was great. Crispy, crunchy bread. A good hefty portion of spiced ham. I asked for banana peppers and they were quite liberal with those. The hoagie was quite nice...and again pretty standard for the area.

The pizza wasn't too great. The crust was nice and crispy, big plus. There was alot of cheese on it....salty, oil and nutty. The only complaint was the sauce...which tasted like canned tomato sauce...no spices or nothing. It was tart and very basic...very bland. Normally I don't fret so much over the sauce as long as the crust is spot on...but they slathered on way too much sauce and it kinda just killed the pizza for me.

The price for a medium 1 topping pizza and a half hoagie plus delivery fee was $18.01...like I said quite pricy for the area. They had a bunch of coupons for specials where we have gotten like twice as much food for just a couple bucks more....but we didn't need a whole hoagie and a large pizza...it woulda been a waste.

All in all...this place is just a little below average. We had the pizza before and we remembered it not being all that great. This second time confirmed this. The hoagies are good though, but plenty of other places in the area have hoagies just as good. The $2.00 delivery fee is a real downer, though.","9HD224rVyahrfg9SNe5SVg",2,"2011-04-12",3,"review",1

The menu is made up of dozens of little dishes that are cheap enough to order by the handful.  When I was there with family, my father-in-law said, ""I've always wanted to order one of everything on a menu.  I can do that here!""  He was pretty excited.

While I would say that little on the Mezzetta menu stands out as extraordinary, it's all very good and the experience is what makes it great.  Dishes of note:  Anything with eggplant is excellent, veggie vine leaves are lemony and good - although a bit mushy, sultan's stew is terrific, roasted peppers and the green beans are divine, falafels are crispy and flavourful.  I haven't tried any of the meat dishes, but they look good on other people's tables.  Fried yams are lacking in crispness and the houmous is lacking in lemon (go for the baba gannoush instead!) but for only a few dollars a dish, you can afford to experiment.

Service is excellent.  True story: my brother-in-law and his girlfriend were there the other day and, it being Passover, couldn't eat the pita bread.  Without a word, the server whisked away the bread and replaced it with whole wheat matzah.  So kind!

You read that right.  If I had to choose one top restaurant, it would be Mezzetta.

I love the concept.  There are some 50 items on the menu and something for everyone.  It is a lot of fun, especially with a small group, to talk and negotiate what you'll order.  The small plates allow you to get many tastes all in one night.  It is the ultimate restaurant for anyone with commitment issues!

The food itself is delicious.  I don't think I have tried one of the dishes that wasn't pretty tasty--and many are really good, even the basics such as the rice.

The service has always been good too; I have never had a problem with slow service or the like.

The value is fair--if you want to stuff yourself silly and spend as little as possible, this is not your place.  But if you are looking for an interesting dining experience where you won't leave hungry or with an empty wallet, this IS your place.

The place can get a little bit crowded depending on the night and time.  I would recommend a reservation.  I have not been here for the music night.  I think it used to be jazz.

They can accommodate a larger party but the ideal size is probably 4 which allows you to sample 20 of the items.  A bigger party means more items but remember that the size of the plates stay the same--hence, people might not get to try everything.

I think one of the best times to come here is ""first date"" night, meaning the first proper date after you've met somebody for coffee or a drink.  Talking about the menu items can break any remaining ice and sharing the plates helps build a bond.  Plus you can then go for a walk along St. Clair.

We somehow spent $94 with tax and tip altogether, which was a bit of a surprise but I guess even with the discount it adds up...especially when you loose track.

Who I am kidding? This restaurant is great. In fact, I have been recommending this Mediterranean and Tapas restaurant to close friends for years. It is cozy, on the medium/small size which actually adds to the vibe of homeyness, without ever being tacky. 

Of course, the highlight is the food: Generally light, tasty, varied, healthy, well priced and although I have never gone on their Loonie and Toonie days, it really seems like I should drop by and check them out!

Personally, I am a huge fan of tapas but generally find most restaurants in Toronto warp the recipe by giving you overpriced or undersized offerings in the $7 range, and although tapas may be small in size, they are supposed to be inexpensive since half the fun comes out of tasting a varied selection. In Spain, tapas can be as inexpensive as .99 cents of a Euro and in a lot of bodegas give you selected number of them for free. I do not expect that here but at the very least, I would prefer they stick to the spirit of the dish(!) and Mezzeta does that.  

Also, FYI, they now have music night, sure there is a $8 covers but really, I can't see how adding live music to your dinner experience could go wrong. 

A great place for a date and also to visit with friends, it is a very amiable and malleable location which easy suits different occasions.

*Exotic Green Beans - Crisp-fried green beans, shaved onion, dill and garlic, dressed spicy hot - not spicy hot at all! But the beans were cooked well, crunchy and fresh! My fave of the night!

*Mushrooms - Tender sautéed button mushrooms served in a garlic vinaigrette - standard, ok but not too exciting!

Not Sharing: (But I made them share with me)

*Kofta - spiced minced beef balls served in a rich tomatoe sauce - Not bad, but not really outstanding..
 
*Dream Sausage -  Flame-grilled beef-lamb sausage, spiced with herbed hot sauce (Stole from Tony F) MEH.. too lamby!

*Fish Shish -  Tasty, marinated marlin or swordfish, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Giulana B) - GREAT! light and refreshing with a hint of lemon

*Lamb Shish - Savoury chunks of marinated lamb leg, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Tony F) - Surprised that I like it! Rich flavour without lamby taste
 
*Vine Leaves -  Herbed minced beef and spiced Basmati rice wrapped in vine leaves and dressed with garlic yogourt and dill (Stole from Giulana) - hey I have no idea I should eat the leaves.. Chinese don't eat the leaves we used that as a wrapping!

*Chicken Shish -  Delicate, juicy marinated chicken breast, flame-grilled - A-OK, but not really memorable!

I have a really enjoyable meal... the bills come out to be $15 per person with taxes and tips. I think I don't mind going on a Toonie Tuesday as a value oriented person that will be the way to go!!

As previously mentioned, this place is indeed a ""little gem"". 

We visited tonight for the Toonie Tuesday special - each dish costs $2.42 on Tuesdays. Bill only came to $30 for 2 people, we had 10 tapas-sized dishes and a juice. 

I especially enjoyed the hummus, dream sausage, Sultan's stew, crispy green beans and the eggplant dip. 

We also had the beef skewers, swordfish, a salmon dish, a rice dish, and potato moussaka. All good. Rice and potato moussaka were a bit bland. Will probably give those a pass next time, because there are 30 other menu items I want to try!

Also worth noting - the service was absolutely great. We had a very friendly server, she knew the menu well, was quick and efficient. 

We arrived early, around 6pm, which seemed to be a perfect time to avoid the rush. Many of the tables were reserved.

Going back to this one for sure! Thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers!","4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ",5,"2010-09-15",3,"review",4

When we arrived to the entrance, I didn't have a good feeling but they were smart enough to display newspaper notes of approval (from 2009) in the windows, so we went in.

We ordered hummus, eggplant, potato kind of empanadas, Phylos dough stuffed with spinach, shrimp, shoulder veal and lamb kebabs, salmon, some kind of red sauce we couldn't say what it was, and something else that if I can't even remember for sure wasn't worth at all.

The service lacked at lot. She didn't gave us a glass of water even when we ordered beer and wine... When the dishes came, a guy and the waitress would just smack the dishes in the glass table without explaining what was what.

But what killed every aspiration of a decent meal was the sound of the pip pip on a microwave... Like seriously they cooked it last night (hopefully) and warmed it for us with love in that thing we didn't even use for popcorn... Try to pretend your meat came from the grill and put the microwave on silence. And yes, after 2 min some dry, chewy meats kebabs were on the table... We ate them for respect to the animals.

The best part of the meal as they recognize was the hummus and the eggplant stew, or I can't tell because they wouldn't have the consideration of telling what dish was what.","4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ",1,"2015-08-30",1,"review",0

Mezzeta is tiny, with seating for no more than 20-25 at a time.  This can make for a cozy meal if you get in, yet frustrating if you're left out in the cold and are starving!

I highly recommend visiting on a Loonie Monday or a Toonie Tuesday.  Although the place is completely packed, service is speedy.  Your servers will maintain a consistent parade of mezze dishes.  

As a self-professed meat lover, I honestly enjoyed the veg dishes most.  Sultan's Stew is a must and Fantastic Falafel speaks for itself!  Skip the salads.  Leave room for everything else!

Make sure to grab a jug of lemonade.  It's made with orange blossom water, which makes it extra fragrant and delicious.  Super cheap too, at $5.

The food itself was pretty good, though nothing really struck out as amazing. The portion sizes were smaller than we expected.

These were about half that size.

They have a special on Monday and Tuesday, but note that it's only for dinner. If you go for lunch, you'll pay the regular tapas price (which isn't that bad).

My boyfriend does Meatless Monday and we had an errand to do nearby, so I suggested Mezzetta based on those endorsements & my long-time intention to visit. When we arrived we discovered that on Monday every 2nd dish up to 15 items costs $1.42 (every Tuesday Every ""mezze"" dish is $2.42, limit of 25 per party). The regular price of each food item on the menu is $3.50. Way to do Meatless Monday!

We ordered about a dozen dishes. The quality was amazing. We enjoyed all of it. Some standouts: I forgot how good falafel could be and then I had theirs. It was some of the best falafel I've had in Toronto, and among the best I've had outside Israel.  Crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside, spiced just right. The smokiness of the baba gannoush was exactly what I like in that dip. The Sultan's Stew, an ""exotic stew of sautéed and spiced eggplant, zuccini, tomato, green and red bell peppers, and onion"", made my mouth happy. The Red Goat salad (""goat"" being the feta cheese) tasted really fresh. 
My least favourite was one of the 2 meat dishes that we ordered (he bent on ""Meatless Monday""): The moussaka. 

Service: Friendly and fast.
Value: Fantastic (though remember, we went on Monday when the most expensive thing we ordered was a pitcher of lemonade).

My boyfriend wants to make it our regular Monday evening destination. I can't argue with that. While I might order some meat items - some chicken or lamb shish, perhaps -  I'm happy to stick with the many vegetable offerings.

"4452",0,"sccPVgHWRAww1atzaOfOYQ","ST-wbjTx6tbHzqYtINLcWg","The pizza competition has a new challenger on Queen. Enter Enzo - I've no idea what their background is, but given that there's one Pizza Pizza down the street, two Pizzaiolos within a 5 min walk, and North Of Brooklyn (their direct competitor) immediately around the corner... let's just say it's a bold move.

On my way to pick up pizza for the team at NoBo, I dashed in to grab some from Enzo for a direct comparison.

I ordered both the Francesco (mushroom, mozz, olives, sausage, artichokes, roasted red) and Pepe (calabrese pepper, pepperoni, onion, olives). Flavour-wise, they sorta tasted the same, though I want to say I liked Pepe better. Both were decent picks, though I don't have a lot of recall on them - I was distracted by work. I'd probably give both a go again some time to check. Co-workers voiced that they liked North Of Brooklyn better (we also had NoBo's Margh and Puttanesca the same day).

But *I* clearly liked Enzo enough to return.

So, I had the Enza (buffalo mozz, fresh basil) today for lunch and really liked this one. The basil was nice and aromatic, the buffalo mozz was fresh and faintly buttery. Photo: https://twitter.com/foodpr0n/status/328945872253640704/photo/1

The crust: I like. On the thick side of thin and with good chew (more chewy than I think many people may like). The bake is just-toasty, and no significant charred bits. Gives it a nice (and even), crispy, outer shell. Taste of the dough is faintly sweet.

Overall, I like it. I feel the ingredients are good, the dough is tasty, and the cost is moderate (well, on the upper edges of that). Wasn't revelatory as that first bite of Libretto pizza years ago, but it's a good pie. Worth a try if you're in the area.","6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ",4,"2013-04-29",12,"review",8

Mike Malve, the owner, has been a good friend of mine for years and I owe him an apology for not doing this sooner.  However, if you get to know Mike, you will feel the same.

Atomic Comics, at all its Arizona locations (not the grubby wannabe in California) is, hands down, the best comic store I have ever been in in my 45 years (sob) on this Earth.  One of Mike's secrets is that he hires people who not only know comics, but have people skills as well.  His employees are actually helpful (no, really).  They can work just as easily with a dyed-in the wool anime geek or a woman looking for a gift for a boyfriend she has only just started dating.  Trust me, these people will help you find a perfect gift (I like gift cards from Atomic if you are wondering).

Atomic's ""secret recipe,"" though, is Mike himself.  When it comes to selling comics Mike is a genius. His stores are spacious, well-lit and organized so that they are welcoming to even a first time buyer.  This is key because a bad shop can turn someone off comics as quickly as a good movie can turn someone onto them.  Mike has cool promotions and sales, often tied in with movie releases, holidays or Rodney Dangerfield's birthday.  If you are near an Atomic store, I encourage you to subscribe to their website.  The weekly coupons alone can save you a fortune.

If you get to know Mike you will learn that he really cares about the industry and making it better, both in terms of sales and content/quality.  As a result, he has a lot of great connections and he works really hard to make people respect the medium as a legitimate art form.  Despite the fact that he is incredibly hard working, he is also one of the kindest and funniest guys you could ever want to meet.

I wanted to know how many copies they had because other stores of similar size  in the valley usually get similar volume. Instead of giving me a straight answer, they tried to pawn off the second printing. I told them I was only interested in the first printing because I'm a colletor. 

 Apparently they thought I was some moron off the street that didn't have any money so they tried to convince me to buy the second printing and convince me that it was going to be a collectors item. They were trying to get me to preorder it.

Anyway, I hate these shady sales tactics. I usually shop at All About Books and Comics but Atomic is closer to my house so sometimes I will pop in there. Now I know why I avoid this place.  They have nice t-shirts but otherwise, I avoid this place. Furthermore, their comics are not always kept in the best condition and many of their issues are wrinkled.

I am pretty sure their Anime is bootleged, but due to how cheap it is and the fact that you usually can't find it anywhere else I don't care.

1) When asking for a shirt to be fitted, I insisted the length be shortened quite considerably. The result was a quasi-belly top that couldn't be tucked in in this or any other reality. Wore it once and binned it. A bloody Thomas Pink number as well...! Numpty.

2) So I have these chinos.... thought I'd get them fitted. The girl in store pinned up the legs but (again) I insisted we could go a bit more fitted, much to her bemusement. She kindly humoured me until the man in charge came out to see what was going on...

Him: ""You okay there?""
Me: ""Great, thanks.""
Him: ""Not too tight?""
Me: ""Hmm... nah they're good.""
Him: ""Can you sit down..?""
Me: ""Suuuure.""

SHHRRRIIIIIIIIIIPP!

I don't think I need to elaborate...! Needless to say he rescued the chinos (and probably made them double-strength!), which I still appreciate even today.

On return from travels, when I started to use these guys again, I noticed the prices had jumped quite considerably, almost double in fact. But in the wake of the credit crunch, it's usually family-owned businesses like these that get hit the worst so if paying double is what it takes to keep these guys going, I'm happy to do my part.","2bgRBwbTD1uPOpM7W6290A",5,"2012-03-19",4,"review",4

For some reason, my man thought I would enjoy this place because I'm an American. Not so much.

Is it authentic? Not really. It's super greasy and the food tastes not-so-fresh. The portions are oversized to the point of being made for people with eating disorders. I didn't find much on the menu that was appealing to me. So I would not say it was made for my palette. 

The only thing I really liked was the free bread they bring out at the beginning of the meal. The music played throughout was also kind of cute. Like a 50's diner theme. No one else in the place seemed to notice or care.

All in all, overpriced junk food akin to what you'd get at a Denny's restaurant in the states. In UK lingo that would be the lowest denominator of a chain diner restaurant at a very bloated price tag. I know that most restaurants in the UK are priced for tourists, but I still think they should at least deliver quality to the price tag they're advertising. This one does not.

Oh, this place also refused to allow me to take home any leftovers in any form. Also a UK thing that I am aware is *somewhat* uncommon but it's not illegal and I do not see how hard it is to invest in some takeaway cartons for people to take home leftovers. I asked and then the waitress would only offer to let me take my pasta home in a dirty ice cream tub. Um, no thanks.","3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw",2,"2013-04-11",3,"review",0

 Once seated we had ordered drinks and when the waiter returned with them I asked him if they no longer done a meal that I had ordered in the past (admittedly some time ago). He informed me that he had worked there for 11 years and that item had never been on the menu.


 Just by way of chat, and in no way complaining, I went on to tell him what the dish was served with in the hope he would come back and say oh that will be .. however what he did say was OK - fine - well lets say we used to serve that, but we don't now and he turned with a face like thunder and walked away leaving me and my husband shocked and embarrassed.


 We decided just to leave our drinks, unpaid for, and on our way out asked to speak to the Manager who we told the story to. All he said was sorry. No questions, never asked who out waiter was, nothing.

The soup base was alright and so were the noodles itself but the meat was in huge chunks. It was also pretty dry and tough so that made it hard to eat.

You can also warm up yourself with a cup of coffee or tea when the temperature is cool.
Go check it out and do not be afraid to talk with the staff, they are so friendly.","4vyBv1GY1n3hCZl7yd02og",5,"2015-11-14",0,"review",0

I've used two of their products over the years.....the Throat Spray & their Chewy Lozenges.  The Lozenges work well, but taste awful.  Even though it's flavored, I don't like it.....by the way, my tolerance level for taking nasty medicine is high...these are at the top of the list.

The Throat Spray is much easier on the taste buds, although you won't be able to taste much of anything after a day or two of using this stuff.  Their older product was very harsh on the taste buds, not any more.....their new spray has a nice Mint flavor to it....so it's very mild.  But the active ingredients in it is what kills the taste for food.  I don't care though, I don't want to get sick.  It works 8 out of 10 times.  When it doesn't work, I get really sick.

Overall, it's a great product and there isn't an alternative out there that I'm aware of.  We always have a bottle of the spray in the house and I have one that I travel with.  You can get a 2 pack at Costco or Sam's Club.

That said we paid him $3k for a project he failed to perform completely and satisfactorily.  Learn from our mistake -- we now have to find another CPA and pay him or her more to finish the job.  

He said he had done the work before and yet he didn't do the job we asked him for and it was basic--there was an outline provided by the relevant government agency that he failed to follow/satisfy.  He simply wasn't up for the task and was so off the mark it makes his representations re: doing similar work before appear fraudulent.  

When we pointed out the deficiencies, at first he agreed to correct them and acted like he was working on it.  Despite knowing that time was of the essence, he didn't respond to any of our inquires re: the status of the project for the better part of a week--and then finally when he responded, he insisted that we were asking for new work that would require more money and he said that while he had already performed the work (bullsh*t) he wouldn't give it to us because he didn't like how demanding my business partner had become.  --I'm only being a little hyperbolic when I say that he did more work on the email asserting his falsified version of events than he did on the financials, clearly preparing a rebuttal for the Better Business Bureau/Board of Accountancy complaint/suit we told him we intend to file.

After talking it over with Erin, we decided the breakfast burger was the ticket. Not sure what it was called, it was hasbrown, egg and bacon on a burger pattie.

Once I recieved my meal, Erin disappeared!!! He dropped off my ticket not 2 minutes after he gave me my food and magically fell off the earth. There was about 10 other waiters/waitress there, discussing what sounded like a meeting but was really just an excuse to sit and gossip. 

Not one of these people asked if I needed anything else...which I did. Tobasco sauce would've been fantastic with my meal. The a/c was set to freeze your ass off, and that if you didn't finish your meal in 10mins, it would be cold.

Finally, I got up and paid for my meal when the hostess walked back to her station. Why do they ask if we want to add anything more to the original bill?

Skip the chain crap and visit Veracruz, conveniently located right between the Chipotle and the Q'Doba (and far better than anything either have to offer).  Pitt students, or anyone who looks like a student pretty much, even get a discount off the already low prices.

Portions are amply sized, and the burritos come in three different sizes unlike the horse-choker-fits-all style of the big chains.  Most of the best stuff on the menu isn't inside a burrito wrapper though, read over the whole menu and ask about any specials if you're unfamiliar, lots of good stuff to be had!

Chorizo, barbacoa, and al pastor double wrapped tacos are now on the menu, as well as other authentic Mexican dishes like chilaquiles and sopes. Authentic Mexican food is a rare find in Oakland (let alone Pittsburgh), so these tasty dishes make Veracruz worth a visit. 

If you're unfamiliar with the aforementioned foods, I suggest you dive in and try them regardless of your personal reservations. Otherwise, Veracruz is simply average in terms of Americanized Mexican fare, such as nachos, quesadillas, and burritos. I actually prefer nearby Chipotle or Qdoba for Ameri-Mex. On a positive note, anything with their earthy, smoky chicken chili is decent, their guacamole is fresh and light, and their homemade red chili and avocado salsas are zesty and tasty.

Relatively cheap prices and a student discount is the icing on the cake (or the guac on the nachos, I guess). Service varies highly depending on who's taking your order.","6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ",4,"2011-09-30",0,"review",0

Last night I went to see a film adaptation of Charles Dicken's novel ""Oliver Twist."" The film,shot on 16mm and released in 1922, was silent with English subtitles. In addition to the film itself, the musical score was played live, in house by a wonderful pianist who played a baby grand piano at the front of the theatre for the entirety of the film - AWESOME. 

I arrived well before the film commenced as I suspected the theatre would be packed. My prediction couldn't have been more inaccurate. I'd say there about 15 people in the audience. This baffles me. 

For $7 (student price), this is the best value for anyone who appreciates the cinema or culture in general.

Why frustrate myself with the wait and then subject myself to an insurmountable taco benchmark? And after being in SF's Mission District just weeks ago?

The truck is an interesting concept, because it serves a different menu from Buster's at the St. Lawrence Market, which I ate at on Friday (very good, by the way).

The truck has the finger food / rolls concept - fish tacos ( $8 for two), shrimp tacos, crab roll, lobster roll ($13). 

I got the fish  tacos. Pretty heavily fried. The fish was fine but nothing compared to the light airiness and freshness of Grand Electric, Playa Cabana, or the permanent location of Buster's in the Market. The fixings were pretty fresh - tomatoes, cabbage, etc...several hot sauces available free of charge. The shell - a soft shell which was crisped on the grill a bit - was a major disappointment - a bit awkward to eat, and not tasty.

Maybe the lobster roll is the thing to get here - if you have lofty fish taco standards like me, I'd avoid the fish tacos though.","6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA",2,"2012-06-21",1,"review",0

Ordered the shrimp and ahi tuna tacos and the key lime pie in a jar. Amazing!!!! Awesome!!! I appreciate that they take your order with your name and call out your name when it is prepared. Very personal, as opposed to a numbered system. 

The food came out warm and delicious, which stayed warm whilst looking for a place to post out with the busy Canada day crowd.  Wow, when I first tasted the shrimp tacos, utterly taken aback! Such crispy shrimp with a spicy batter, tasty coleslaw type filling.  The taste was unique and on point. The ahi tuna was thick, delicious and seared perfectly.  Again, amazing blend of flavours. The taco shells were delicious and fresh.  Salsa was delicious, fresh tomatoes, and onions (can't tell what else it's made of but just deliciousness). Yum.  Fantastic medley of flavours and textures.  The tacos also came with three small slices of lime, they don't play around they give you enough to juice up your tacos.  They also give you good quality thick napkins. 

For desert, had the key lime pie in a jar. I love that idea! Especially for a food truck, it's great on the go, really keeps it clean while eating on the go. Would make a great present too. Beautiful packaging complete with a cute green ribbon and bow :).

The cost of the two tacos are ten dollars and the key lime pie was eight dollars, tax inclusive.  Would definitely try again!","6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA",5,"2016-07-02",0,"review",1

This is a review for their food truck. I had this at the Beaches Jazz Fest so it was a welcome reprieve not to have to wait in line for eons as I would have at TUM or elsewhere. Staff were quick, on the ball and friendly. 

THE GOODS
I got the lobster roll and unlike the competition, it's not doused in mayo. It's super fresh lobster and you get quite a good portion of it but not enough to feel super full. Maybe that's why they give you the chips? (which a bag of Miss Vickie's alongside just seems kind of cheap. Sorry).  You also get a big ass dill pickle which I like. Slather some of that all of my lobster, please and thanks! I feel like the lobster could use a wee bit more flavouring but they don't want to distract from it either. It's a delicate balance. 

That said, even though the lobster is delicious (and maybe it's just the cost of importing it), it's just expensive at $13. Get rid of the chips and charge $8 to $10 for that sucker and you'll double your volume. I can get a Keg Prime Rib Burger with TWO sides in a brick and motar restaurant for the same price (compartively speaking...I know it's not lobster but still). 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Swim to the ocean...but you'll be paying for it. Curious about their tacos. Maybe next time. They're much more reasonable at $8 for two sizeable portions.","6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA",3,"2012-07-29",1,"review",1

Cons: The bread is some sort of a garlic loaf, so definitely not authentic. 
Pros: The shrimp was HUGE so totally made up for the price of the sandwich (I think it was $10?)

It comes with a pickle and a bag of Miss Vicky's chips. This is needed due to the size of the roll, and I am glad they understand this. The best part of the lobster roll though is not the lobster itself, but the buttery bun they put it on. I have also taken part in the shrimp tacos there, and they were good and more filling than the lobster roll...

Overall, the product tastes good, but because it's not a portion I can feel full on it's not a place I would frequent regularly. I have opted to stick to making my own lobster rolls... but for those of you who don't want to go through that hassle, this roll is at least better than what they offer at 416 Snack Bar :)","6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA",3,"2012-11-12",0,"review",0

The lobster roll comes on a folded sliced bread (folded from the factory, I might add - I don't know how else to describe this, you just have to see it) which is buttered and toasted. The lobster is shredded and mixed with light mayo and chives and other herbs. It comes with a bag of Ms. Vickies chips, two quartered pickles, and a slice of lemon.

I didn't have the fish tacos ($8 for two) but my friend did and the fish was heavily battered and the tortilla got soggy and fell apart halfway through. Didn't look very appealing to me but he said it tasted good.

Now I've read the other reviews prior to posting this, and ill have to agree, the fish is battered pretty heavily and the taco shells fall apart, but the latter is not because of the heat, they put the salsa and cabbage underneath the meat!

I was extremely excited to hear that RBC Plaza would be ""featuring"" food trucks in front of their building during the summer months. One highly anticipated food truck to make its appearance was Buster's Sea Cove. 

The trucks are usually there from 11am-3pm or until they sell out of product. I've gone to buster's food truck twice, both times they ran out of lobster roll fixings. The lines are always long from 12-2. It's best to go early to avoid the long wait (1130ish) and if you go after 2 you run the risk of having only a limited selection of food to choose from (ie no lobster rolls).

I ordered 1 crab roll which came with a small bag of Miss Vicki's chips and a pickle on the side.

The portion size of the meal was disappointingly small. The roll was essentially 1 regular piece of wonder bread, toasted, and folded in half with the crab stuffing in the middle.The crab roll itself was delicious in taste consisting of creamy, buttery, salty Alaskan crab! It left me salivating and wanting more. 

Overall, $10 for 1 slice of bread seems kind of an absurd amount of money to spend on a small sandwich but I suppose a good argument can be made that it's not the bread you are paying for but the crab and also the quality of taste that the overall crab roll has to offer. I don't know if I would be willing to wait in another long line up for such a small sized meal that I find to be overpriced but I do still want to try their lobster rolls and I hear they are opening a location in the PATH http://bustersseacove.ca/blog/busters-sea-cove-is-coming-to-the-path/ .

The flowers were beautiful, but they were on the verge of opening. They opened completely today and are still beautiful, but now they will be ready to throw out in a day or two when they start dropping petals, turning brown on the edges and dying out. I've always received roses that were still quite closed on arrival, so that they lasted at least a week and you got a longer time to enjoy them.

The three people im with all order AFTER me and then ALL get their food. Im waiting..waiting.. after about 10 ish minutes and my friends PLUS all the people after me getting their food I go up and ask where my burrito is...they all look around at each other and are like ""ummmm we accidentally gave it to a car in the drive thru"" so my first thought is...IF YOU REALIZE THIS WHY DIDNT YOU MAKE ANOTHER ONE!? Whatever. The worst is yet to come. Get my burrito..yes, its piping hot. So I take a bite..hmm no potatoes and by being the freak I am; I then decide to open it up and look...nope, no potatoes. Roll it back up and decide to eat it because im starving. Well after about 2 bites grease just comes POURING out..im not talking a little bit a grease..a TON of it!! I have ate at Filly's/ Los Favoritos/Someburros all these kind of places and NEVER HAVE EVER ON ANYTHING experienced SO MUCH GREASE. I put down the burrito and my hands were covered in grease, my napkins, plate. Too disgusting to eat. So by now all my friends are done anyways and I just threw it away. It was only 5 bucks...but they will never get my 5 bucks again.

I've read the previous reviews and I think they must have improved a lot of the problems since I've discovered it because I haven't been aware of any of them.

I think this place is the best in froyo against the Mojo and Yogurtland I've visited. I like that they have a variety of flavors but am bummed when I go in and they don't have them. As long as they have the original tart I can be happy.

My favorite flavors are green apple and mango, and the fruit is always fresh and sweet. The place is decorated like any other cute little froyo joint and the girl behind the counter is always nice. Although I can't imagine what it must be like when it's packed and people are asking for samples because whenever I go in it's not busy.

Overall, it's a low-key and tasty froyo spot. It's a bit far from where I live but it's worth the drive for good frozen yogurt. I also dig the reward point system they have - it definitely makes the trip a bit better.","2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ",4,"2010-05-14",0,"review",0

California has so many and Arizona has so few - makes no sense) and I was hoping they would have tart yogurt like Pink Berry, or at least like MoJo's and lucky me, they did! 

I looked on-line before they opened and saw they had a twitter account and on that it said for their grand opening weekend yogurt was buy-one-get-one half off so we all went in on a Saturday afternoon looking for just that. 

They place is very small, but decorated well with green tile and all the yogurt machines are in the walls. Unlike MoJo's, when you come in the door and do it all your self here the yogurt girls want to serve you the samples themselves (for all I know, maybe even the yogurt). We asked about the BOGO and the girl had no idea about so she went to ask her manager. She came out and said the manager would only do it with the coupon so I had to explain that twitter doesn't come with a coupon and their tweet said nothing about a coupon.  So she had to go back to get the manager to intervene.  (Check out their tweet on August 16 at 4:02 pm http://twitter.com/ZwirlYogurt) She argued with me for a while and I understood where she was coming from, she obviously wasn't in charge of the twitter account, but come on. You need to be aware of what's going on with your business. She conceded and said that she could do it for us and to let us know when we were ready and she would personally ring us up. 

At that point we had sampled a couple of flavors here and there waiting for answers and we weren't too impressed. The original tart was bland. I know that's what you would expect, but it's not bland at MoJo's or Pink Berry's. Kind of like the difference of fat free ice cream compared to the real thing (only this is all fat free). I also tried the tart pomegranate and that also tasted like it was missing something. My husband tried a couple too and that alone seemed to satisfy him. I just took a lick off my sample cups and gave the rest to the toddler so he was in heaven so after all that we decided the yogurt just wasn't worth it BOGO or not and we left. Sadly we won't be back. We'll stick with Golden Spoon and when I'm lucky to be close enough to MoJo's, I'll get my fix there. That being said, I hope they do well, I don't want to see any businesses fail.","2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ",2,"2009-09-04",2,"review",2

Staff are welcoming and very friendly.  The interior is very nice; clean.  Parking is odd.. There is this shady looking lot in the back; thankfully street parking was available and we were able to find a spot without too much trouble.

Reason for one star???? The cut.  Who cares how friendly the staff is, how chic the interior is if they can't execute a haircut properly or at the very least LISTEN to what the customer is requesting??  

I came in with an angled bob that was slightly grown out as the ends were touching my shoulders.  The stylist was asked to TRIM this back so that the ends were no longer touching my shoulders, just sitting above them. That's it.  Keep the exact same haircut that I came in with, however, clean it up.  I showed her two photos of how the cut looked like when I had first had it down and she even repeated 'give it a trim and clean it up'.   Great. We are on the same page.

For the angled cuts, the patron is asked to look down so that their chin is almost touching their chest while the stylist cuts the back.  When I was able to look up again I was stunned into silence by the fact that most of the length of my hair in the back was GONE.  I didn't realize that this stylist was either a) hard of hearing b) doesn't know what the eff shoulders are.  It sounds almost ridiculous as I am a grown woman but I felt sick and seriously in shock that my hair was cut so short that I was unable, at that moment, to even say anything as I feared I would lose it.  My hair was all on the floor so at this point there was nothing that could be done to rectify this. To give an idea I went in with hair that was about a half inch below my shoulders and I left with hair so short you cannot tie it back into a pony tail.  Not only was the cut WAY too short, it was too dramatic an angle compared to what I came in with and what I asked to have restored.  

Needless to say I would NEVER return and would sooner venture to cut my hair with a butter knife prior to returning to this place again.  My husband also got his hair cut and wasn't entirely happy with his as he felt the stylist didn't really listen to instruction (seems a theme with this place).  I should have taken the lack of reviews as a tip.  

Total cost for two haircuts (ladies and male) was $90 - which is usually the cost for one decent haircut anywhere else.  I would much rather pay for a quality stylist who listens to what the customer is asking than save money on what would be the Dollarama version of a haircut.

Avoid..unless you really like surprises involving your hairstyle.","9DfSK6PUG4qHzuMfIYDxBA",1,"2015-12-09",2,"review",0

Foolishly and uncharacteristically, I did not check Yelp because my wife said she had been here in the past and it was fine.  She obviously blotted it from her mind as a horribly traumatic experience.

When we walked in, we didn't need to be seated because there was only one other couple in the restaurant, the first bad sign. The second was there was not a server in sight.  After about 5 minutes, a sever did appear from the back somewhere.  She asked for our drink order and I told her we were ready to order our dinners also, My wife ordered lasagne, which was an early bird special.  Bad sign #3.  The waitress asked her if she wanted the lunch or dinner portion (it was 6:30pm).  My wife replied that she wanted the early bird special.  The waitress grabbed the menu to examine it stating that she wasn't familiar with it because she was just here temporarily.  I ordered the Chicken Cacciatore and iced tea.

Bad sign #4.  The waitress brought my iced tea. What could be wrong with iced tea? It was the foulest, most undrinkable concoction I ever attempted to drink.  When the waitress came by, I told her the iced tea was undrinkable & to bring me a Diet Coke. She came back shortly with a glass of regular Coke because they didn't carry Diet.  I said fine.  Shortly thereafter, an older man came out and said he heard that my tea wasn't good so he would bring me a fresh one.  He brought me the (fresh) one.  I didn't think it was possible, but it tasted worse than the first one.

The salads came and they were OK.  They had fresh leaf lettuce, with tomato and onion, but the italian dressing tasted like Wishbone (Thank God they didn't make it themselves).

Now for the entrees.  I won't go into any detail, but suffice it to say, if Taco Bell & Jack in the Box made lasagne and Chicken Cacciatore, I would eat it there before I'd set foot in this restaurant.  By the way, I haven't been to either of those places in the past 20 years.

My wife and I agreed, this was the worst restaurant we have ever eaten in and I'm talking about literally thousands of restaurant meals.  I cannot fathom how this ""restaurant"" is still in existence.

I have definitely learned my lesson.  I will never ever forget to check Yelp before I go to a new restaurant for fear that I might have blotted this nightmare out of my mind as my wife obviously did.","8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw",1,"2013-04-05",7,"review",3

The food was average. They had really good ranch dressing and a salad that used actual green lettuce (romaine) which I was impressed with, considering.

One star reviews are rare for me. I'll usually go back at least once to give them another chance. But I'll make an exception in this case, because there's no way I'm ever goin' back to this place.

Should have known something was up when the waitress brought our drinks over talking on a cordless phone. ""No,"" she said. ""I can't talk right now. No. I'm working. I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks. Can I call you back? I'll call you back. Bye."" When she put the phone down we ordered the eggplant parmesan. Big mistake. Looked and tasted like someone hid it at the bottom of the deep fryer and forgot about it. For 3 days. There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant. More like... cardboard. mmmm... cardboard parmesan. Seriously, it was gross. Sad thing was we were absolutely starving and on our way to a show so we ate it. Well, most of it. It came with a side of spaghetti, which was all right. Not as gross as the eggplant, but still not good.

Thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert. Worst canoli ever. The dough was hard and stale, and the filling was strangely sour and so thick that technically I don't think it could be classified as cream. More like... gel.

Just one other table in the whole place.  Should have tipped me off.  The place is good sized, has a nice bar and a pool table in the back.  2 tv's were showing different sports channels above the bar.  I couldn't help but feel like this was more of a bar that served Italian food than an Italian restaurant w/ a bar.

My service was fine.  The girl serving me was pleasant, but not exactly interested in being there.  The food was nothing above ok.  The sauce was fine, a bit sweet, but ok.  The pasta hadn't seen al dente in so long it would have needed a map to get back there.  And the garlic bread on the side was so dry it felt like they used stale bread before toasting it.  This was their special of the day.  Don't you want your special to be the things you do well?

And in the southwest it's even harder to find a good neighborhood restaurant that serves Italian food.  In today's world of fast food and chain restaurants, people tend to choose the Olive Garden over a small business when the craving for good pasta and/or pizza dishes.  Carmen's Bistro on Baseline in Tempe lets one go back for a nice Italian meal without the hassle of corporate America's set menu.  A small place that mixes neighborhood bar with neighborhood restaurant, Carmen's is perfect for a night with friends or even a quiet setting to bring a date for the first time.  As you walk up, the kitchen if fully exposed so that one can watch the cooks prepare tasty delights that come out of the kitchen.
 Upon arriving with a group of friends from out of town for an early afternoon dinner, we took a seat in the corner of the dimly lit restaurant.  The menu is traditional American Italian cuisine, serving everything from anti pasta to spaghetti with marinara to pizza.  Everyone in the group had the same thought as we looked at the menu, and a round or calzones was ordered by all, with two people getting fried zucchini sticks and a salad to start.  Arrival of the first course was quick, though the person that ordered the fried zucchini was surprised to see that the zucchini he ordered magically turned into fried mozzarella sticks.  Instead of sending it back, he ate them with much delight.  A small mistake turned into a lovely appetizer that was served with marina sauce for dipping.  The salad that came out was simple, your basic garden salad, that was portioned for a quick bite before the main course, not to filling.
 The calzones then came out a little later.  Wait time was about twenty minutes, acceptable considering that they are made fresh in the kitchen.  The crust on the calzone was very basic, and not seasoned all that much.  A little garlic power would've gone a long way.  The same marinara sauce that was served with the mozzarella sticks came with it, for the same dipping purposes.  The sauce it self was a little sweet to taste, and served cold.  Heat would've made it a little more enjoyable, and of course a little garlic might take away the extra sweetness that was brought on by the tomato.  The filling in the calzone was hot, but not too hot to where one might burn their mouth.  The mixture that was in the calzone was your basic pizza toppings and could've been seasoned with Italian herbs for extra flavor, a little disappointing to say the least.
 A very filling meal for everyone in the group, though not as satisfying for one's taste buds.  Service was not bad, but the screw up with the appetizer might be more a reflection of a lack of attention to detail by our server and not the cook.  Carmen's Bistro has a nice foundation in place, but still has some work to do if it wants to be considered a fine Italian food at a decent rate.  Still, it was better than the corporate menu and over trained service at the Olive Garden, making it a nice place to walk up to and eat, but not a place to set your plans to for an evening.","8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw",3,"2009-01-03",0,"review",0

Find a studio that offers a 30 or 45 minute class and at least get used to the heat.

I'm loving my Passport to Prana-I feel like I'm on a yoga tour of Toronto, constantly exploring.   I decided to go to the Sunday 9.30am class here and somehow managed to make it on time.  Phew!

The studio is downstairs with a small, bright reception area.  The staff were chatty and welcoming and checked about my prior experience (minimal).  I was advised again to stay in the room, drink water if I needed it etc.  Andrew told me he'd be the one inflicting torture on me for the day.   Sense of humour?  Bonus points!

The change rooms are really nice.  Ikea-esque furnishing with lots of black shelves and benches.  4 sparkling clean showers, couple of toilets, hairdryers and some lockers.  I love having lockers.  No thinking!  Towels and mats are available to rent.

The studio itself is modern and open.  Again it was completely spotless.  The floors are black wood with red lines to show you where to put your mat.  I had more trauma trying to figure out where the top of the room was to avoid accidentally placing myself in the front row again.  Tip:  the instructor has a big box/stage to stand on at the front....opposite the door.   All the walls are mirrored so you get to correct your posture from every angle...and/or watch how your face transitions from normal to pink to red to purple as the class progresses.  Fun!

I enjoyed Andrew's class.  Most of the instructions were quite like my other class in Bikram Yoga Centre but he also told us why we were doing the poses in a certain way and was very good at describing adaptations and progressions.  He told little stories about his own practice which really made the class feel more easy going and was enormously encouraging.  He learnt all our names and dragged us through, pushing us as a group and individually.   He also had a sense of humour and fabulous enthusiasm-for the stick pose we were meant to look ""like a T! For Toronto!"" the first time....and ""like a T!  For TORTURE!"" the second time.  Made it (almost) fun!

The cool shower I had afterwards was just blissful and luckily they have dispensers in the stalls with some kind of shower gel/shampoo substance...I'd forgotten mine.  

Would I go back?  Yes!  In fact, I'm seriously considering buying a class card....they've a special at the moment with 40 classes for $350.  Hmmm....tempting!","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",4,"2010-08-15",7,"review",4

LOVE the studio size, decor and set up - 4 showers; a vanity area with 2 hairdryers lots of room for changing, shoe rack ,ockers and lots of room in...general. I think this was possibly one of the biggest studios.

When we walked in someone greeted us with a smile, told us where we need to go. As we were walking to the change area, there was someone wiping puddles of sweat on the ground with a towel so you don't break your neck as you enter/exit the studio.

SUPER HOT. I forgot about the heat (I did really poorly btw at this session since it's been so long) - but I was sweating like crazy and I KNEW even though I am dying now, the afterwards would be sweet.  I was wrong; afterwards I felt SO GOOD even though I felt like a jello and was walking around like I had been sitting on a horse for hours, even though my thighs didn't stop jiggling for hours after - I felt like I was high and life was so sweet and now that I survived that, NOTHING COULD bother me. Until Monday at 7am when my alarm starts to yell at me.

ANOTHER REALLY LOVELY THING that would NORMALLY ANNOY:
3 days after the session, I got a quick call from a very perky and happy sounding lady to check to see how I liked it and if I had any questions or concerns. THIS would normally drive me insane but I appreciated it so much, you have no idea - I was smiling about it all day.

2 things I wasn't too happy about:

There's ONLY 2 dryers - and 10 women; amazingly enough, this worked out really well but you did feel super guilty about the fact there is a woman waiting to use it and you can see her through the mirror - but this is really minute - I mean really, I was boiling as it was that if i left my hair alone, it probably dried just as quickly - but for those who like to sweat while they dry their hair, a 3rd dryer would have been good.

I had a really hard time getting into my ""zone/meditative state"" or whatever - but that was probably because I was going to barf because I ate before I came. I also think - and this could be just me - but that there should have been some separation of levels. She acknowledged that we had a LOT of new people but never indicated that if you're a beginner, this is where you should stop, if you think you can do it this is a level higher and so on. Also often on the poses the ""goal"" was missed (things like the goal here is to lock your knees -if not your pose hasn't started). 
I think partially the reason I personally couldn't get into my zen is because I was automatically listening for the words ""now if you're more advanced..."" to stop and focus on my pose, which was never said. 
It's also helpful to distinguish that so the first timers don't feel COMPLETELY INAPT and feel that this is only for advanced and not beginners because they try to follow with and failed.

Mind you that was my first class; my friends have agreed that we'll try 2 more before we sign up so hopefully we'll have better luck...next time - but if you've done Bikrum before, this is a great little spot.","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",4,"2011-09-28",0,"review",0

I am a avid hot yogi, but I had never visited a Bikram specific studio before. I went to a six pm class, which is perfect for after work. I was met by two guys at the desk who had no problem checking me in with my Passport to Prana, and they answered all of my questions. I was peckish, having had a very early lunch, so the one suggested a Vitamin C supplement before class for $1. I felt great, I think the little hit of sugar was exactly what I needed. That was nice.

The building that houses the studio has several signs, and it may be confusing where to enter. Head to the left, and down the stairs. The lobby is bright, and the desk is right there. This studio is very minimal and organized. Plenty of room to hang your mats to dry, plenty of shoe storage, a multitude of cubbys and coat racks and lockers for your use. The change room is large and spotless, with a fantastic FOUR showers (super clean). 

The class was very good. The instructor (Trish?) learned my name, and was constantly checking on me throughout the class. She did minimal physical adjustments, but a great deal of verbal coaching which was nice. It is very hot, but not unbearable. I had no issues with dizziness or nausea, but I do have some experience. 

Bonus Points
- Love the red lines along the floor in the studio, to keep us all in line
- Love the large, clean change rooms and four showers. 
- Love the organized shoe solutions, no tripping over boots
- Eco-Friendly points for no paper towels in the washroom

Minus Points
- I really like visiting the website and seeing a photo and bio of the instructors. The website has no mention of the instructors OR which teacher is teaching which class. 
- To fill your bottle with their filtered water is an extra charge.
- The entire environment is very sterile (which i am sure many people like) I like a little more character in my yoga-studio decor.
- The front desk guys were helpful, but didn't physically show me around. I know the place is small, but I still really like the tour.
- Bikram is not really my thing. I'll give it another shot, but I don't know. No Vinyasas (!)
- Bloor Street bicycle parking is minimal, no rack out front.

Overall, It was a nice studio, and the teacher was good. I am not sure about Bikram overall. It is the same series of 26 poses in every class which may get boring if you like a challenge. Very little upper body strengthening poses and no Vinyasas, which I love. I missed the improvisation and flow. 

Although this sounds questionable, as it is a 40 degree experience, I found that what this studio was lacking overall was a little warmth.","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",3,"2010-09-22",4,"review",3

I enjoyed the hotter temperatures compared to Moksha that made for a deep, challenging class.  The instructor chatted a bit too much with too many wisecracks for my liking.  Some students laughed, so take that as a completely personal preference.

The studio is spacious.  The changerooms are well appointed with lockers, lots of space for changing and an appropriate number of shower stalls.  There's a closet for hanging up your jacket in the front near reception which opens up the space in the changeroom as well.","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",3,"2010-12-28",4,"review",2

It makes sense why people call it the torture chamber. It really is a butt-kicking. But  BYT Bloor does their best to make the 90 minute torture as pleasant as it could be. The studio is beautiful. I really enjoy the dimly lit, dark floored practice room - it tricks you into thinking it can't be that hot (hint: it can). The studio is accented with hints of red, not sure if they were aware it further contributes to the torture idea. Change rooms have enough cubby holes, but I've never been to a class where it wasn't jam packed, so I still could appreciate some more room. The 4 showers are uneventful, with just a soap dispenser in each.

The staff are okay in person. I'm not sure if I really connected with any of the teachers. I think it's easy for the students to disengage from the teacher when you're just one amongst more than 50 people in a dim room, going through the same poses, bearing the intense heat. One thing I did appreciate from BYT was they called me a few days after my first class to ask how I enjoyed everything - I don't know why I thought that made me happy. Unfortunately, I guess that was the end of the personal touches.

I personally enjoyed coming here (I haven't tried any other Bikram studios, just other hot yoga) but I think I've found other ones more to my liking.","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",3,"2012-01-21",0,"review",0

I feel the exact same way. I myself also speak very quickly but this guy! (the instructor) was unbelievable! I've been practicing yoga now for 2 years on and off. My usual studio is Moksha Downtown (mix of bikram and ashtanga) or Downward Dog (Ashtanga). I'm use to the calm and relaxing feel i get from yoga. When i decided to try Bikram I was super excited, i loved hot yoga, so why not? 

CONS:
1. This is a con and a pro I guess but the class is HOT HOT HOT, i literally thought I was going to FAINT when i came in, and ive done alot of yoga in my lifetime 
2. I didn't really enjoy the class doors or the red lines, i know it's suppose to be sleek and all, but I kind of felt like i was in a bad remake of an electra movie
3. i felt out of place immediately, maybe it's because i came early and did a flow on my mat ( :S, there are no flows in Bikram) 
4. the instructor was talking at the speed of light! I literally was shell shocked, i didn't know if he was actually instructing a class or telling me to run cause the place was on fire
5. when he tried to correct me on a pose, he didnt come over and gently guide me, it was more like "" YOU- YOU - YOU THERE IN THE BLUE - BLUE TANK TOP- HAND RIGHT- RIGHT HAND- DOWN- DOWN-DOWN-DOWN-DOWN-DOWN KAY GOOD! ""
6. I seriously felt the elitest vibe going on, it was super competitive, and people were wearing matching yoga bras and undies and i could see their butt cheeks sticking out in class! (it's yoga, not a VS fashion show)
7. i don't know if its because the changerooms are small and cramped, (the ladies aren't at least), but after class people were sitting huffy and puffy on the floor outside the changeroom doors

PROS:
1. the greeting staff were very nice and friendly, they told me the class would be really HOT (true to their word)
2. it's located relatively close to st. george station (5 min walk)
3. they called me to follow up a week later, which was nice i guess, but i also felt awkward cause extreme fitness would do that and god knows i hate them. 

OVERALL, i will not be returning. But for people who are super competitive and like sweating buckets, GO FOR IT! 

ps. i asked them why they talked so fast, they told me its because there's alot of instruction to dole out, and the talking distracts from the heat.","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",3,"2011-06-19",0,"review",0

For those of you who haven't taken a Bikram class, it's quite...aggressive. If you're looking for soft and soothing and meditative, this most definitely is not the place. You will be challenged and the super-hot temperature and inability to leave the room will take you to hell and back. Strangely enough I found myself craving the heat after a few classes. But seriously - it's so hot there are points that you think you might not make it.

For some reason, the place smells a bit ""spicy"". I think it might be due to the clove-based mat cleaner that studios seem to be using.

Personally, Bikram is not my bag (not enough spiritual focus for me), but for those who are very ""alpha"" and who feel that they aren't working out unless they're pouring out sweat, this place could be for you.","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",2,"2011-05-12",1,"review",0

I still stand by the fact that the place did not smell very good, and the changerooms were ridiculously busy (people piled on top of people - literally), but the class itself I suppose was conducive to a typical Bikram Yoga class.

Be forewarned, if you're looking to do yoga as a means of relaxation, with a smooth transition from one pose to another, Bikram is not for you. I won't be going back!","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",2,"2011-02-18",1,"review",0

It was like Hot Yoga, but with an auctioneer as an instructor.

2nd stop on my Passport to Prana and I had a very disruptive and confusing practice.

Signed up for a 90 minute 6:00pm class on a Tuesday night.  The staff were courteous with the signup and gave me enough information to know where to go and what to expect.

Washrooms were decently sized with individual stalls for showers.  As again, a suggestion is to arrive early because this class was packed to capacity.

The studio space itself was a bit smaller than I normally am used to.  Since it is situated in the basement I believe that limited their ceiling, so it gave the studio a bit of a cramped look.  3 of the 4 walls of the studio were lined with floor to ceiling mirrors, so good if you needed to evaluate your posture from different angles.

My experience in studios tend to be a very relaxing and meditative one.  Where people respect the silence in their practice that allows them to focus deeper with each pose.  This class was the antithesis of that.  Not only were the other classmates disruptive from the start of class, but several had to be reminded to stop chattering during class.  Normally this would be an annoyance for me, but to be honest, I could hardly tell from the constant jabber from our instructor.  His voice was loud, disruptive, and relentlessly overbearing.  It literally was like an auctioneer trying to sell off different poses.  Every time he took a sip of water was a relief to my ears and mind.  Even when we were to lie down in Savasana, we were constantly reminded loudly how we were supposed to take the time and relax and breath and-and-and-and...*CLAP* - seriously...what's with the loud claps in between poses?  It's just unnecessary.

It was a dizzying 90 minutes and very unsettling for me.  I'd might go back for another class with another instructor but their website doesn't indicate who the instructor will be.  So maybe not.","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",2,"2011-01-12",4,"review",1

Although a convenient location, you walk down the stairs into a pit of stinkyness and sweat. 
I've written to the studio before about this but there's been no improvement. 

The tiled hallway is always drenched with sweat, not water. It's disgusting and it has the stench of stale b.o.  Everytime I am here I try to spend as little time in this hallway. 

The room is big and has lots of mirrors. Bikram isn't like another form of yoga like there are different types of dances. I find that their attitude is completely different than traditional yoga although based on the same foundations. They don't care about alignment or how your body feels , and the point is to push you to your limits. 
I mean, I was called out for keeping my knees bent in savsana when I know it's appropriate when my low back hurts. 

I also got called out for having flip flops in the room. I'm sorry, but how do you expect me to leave the studio while stepping in puddles of sweat. It's so gross. 

Also I find the people that come here are of a certain type. Just because you come here often and stand in the front doesn't mean that you can leave puddles of sweat in the studio. Clean up after your own mess! But the studio doesn't seem to care or enforce it. 
On top of that she picks up her mat and drips all along the studio floor AND ON TOP OF ME! From my shoulder to toe. So gross !!!!!!!!!

Dana and Damien have a great thing going on here - a well organized studio with great instructors all around (some I prefer over others, like anything in life) but overall this is a well-oiled machine.

NOW - I've noticed many reviews on Yelp that question the integrity/cleanliness/philosophies of the studio and I have to say, Bikram Yoga is not for everyone.  For those thinking of trying it out - please do some research before hand.  This is not your mother's yoga practice.  There will be no sun salutations.  There will be limited time to meditate.  You will sweat balls.  You will be encouraged to NOT leave the hot room (and yo, it's HOT).

It can and will get stinky (there are a lot of sweaty people milling around!) expect this!  You will see other people's sweat (do you really think it can be avoided?)  I dunno, for me - this is not a big deal, this is part of Bikram, and I challenge anyone to find a Bikram studio where this is not the norm.  Overall, I'd say the facility is as clean as can be expected (and I don't particularly find sweat - especially not bikram induced sweat- to be that ""dirty"").  

You don't play by your own rules in Bikram, so if you have penchants for blocks and other apparatus - this is prob not the yoga practice for you.  And that's ok - but you need to know this before you come back online to rant and rave about how ludicrous the idea is.  Just me $.02

All in all, I find a lot of solace in this place.  I've been a student here for a long time, and I thoroughly enjoy each and every class.  The way you feel afterwards makes it all so worth it.","B3o5KdHU1eQUTc5LhAamzw",5,"2012-11-10",0,"review",0

On 1/7 I emailed Matt to ask when they would get the correct trays so we could switch the incorrect for the correct trays he said he would have them tomorrow and wanted to set up a day the owner (Rick) who frequents the area could pick them up. 1/11 Matt asked if Wednesday 1/13 worked I said yes between 11am-8pm he said okay. Around 8pm Rick called and said he was late and asked if we could reschedule and i said okay. He never contacted us to reschedule. 1/18 I emailed Matt requesting a full refund and they could pick up the incorrect pans when it was convenient for them. 2/2 Matt apologized and asked for our credit card information which I replied no to because we paid by check. 2/6 we sent a very upset email because it still had not been resolved which Matt replied that Rick (the owner) would bring us a check and pick up the pans on Monday. 2/8 Matt asked what number to give Rick to call when he was here which he already had from previous call to reschedule the initial pick up but I gave it to him anyways Rick never showed up! 2/10 I emailed Matt and asked him to mail me a check for the full amount and he said the secretary would mail the next day but then she called out sick which he notified me of which was fine. 2/16 was the set pick up date by FedEx for the pans but I initially told Matt I needed the check first which he said I should receive Monday or Tuesday prior to pick up. The check never came so we did not send the pans. After that we left a message with the secretary told her everything that has happened and that we needed to speak to Rick. It was late so he called the next day left a voice mail and said he would be there until 4pm.

During my afternoon visit to South Queensferry, I stopped in for a pretty decent lunch and a pint of Deuchar's IPA. The lunch special was cheap and the food was fresh. I didn't have to wait too long to get service, and once again, the people working there were nice to me (and the others who were in there as well). 

I thought they had a good selection of beer to choose from, the menu was small but everything looked good, and the service was good (by pub standards). I can't think of too much that is wrong about this place. This place also had lots of locals in there when I stopped in. And that's a good thing. People were genuine and the staff was nice to us all.

It provides a good selection of local ales and provides a reasonably priced menu, which offers your staple pub food. When I was in there were quite a few tourists, however the bar staff told me that the locals (that every pub has) only come out in the evening when the tourists are few.

I found all the staff here were very friendly but for some reason the rest of the clientele were a bit grumpy. It might have just been the awful weather outside so I'll try not to let that cloud my judgement too much. The Ferry Tap has a great selection of ales (it does sell itself as an ale house) and offers some really nice traditional pub food for less than you'd often pay in central Edinburgh. Haddock or scampi will cost you around £6.95. In general expect to pay between £6 and £7. They also serve some more light bites, like paninis and baked potatoes.

a bit partial to the mid-century i was disappointed that there were only two booth that gave me my fix. however, these booths were GOOD.

this place gets such high marks because
1) there is little, if any, junk. just good plain OLD stuff
2) save for a couple of candles, there are no new booths trying to sneak in old-looking new things. i hate that.
3) they are markedly green conscious: signs praising you for shopping second hand and keeping a three foot high stack of splayed-out newspaper for wrapping gifts.

I took the kids here after a day at the Falcon Field Air Museum, they were hot, tired and hungry. After explaining (a few billion times) that this was not ""fast food"" and the burger wouldnt fly into their mouths as we sped through a drive through, they settled down.

Have I mentioned that my grandkids havent been taught much in the ways of ""someplace different""? 
 I'm working on that.
The space is nice, with a mixture of booths, tables and a counter in the front window. 
The counter where you order overlooks a clean and shiny grill, with assorted pictures of the offerings for those that have trouble reading the menu board.

With that setup.. heres the rundown.
I wanted to try a Chicago style dog, my grandson wanted a hamburger, and the granddaughter wanted a corn dog.
The hamburger was a fine if unremarkable version. Which was perfect, decent 1/4 Lb patty & Bun, melted american cheese, nice and tasty.
The corn dog was about the same as you would find anywhere, also good (especially for a 3 year old who doesnt like culinary suprises!)

My jumbo hot dog was good, the actual weiner and bun itself was extremely unremarkable, in fact, and I'm sorry to say, I rather prefer the hot dogs at Costco (not the buns though!) it tasted like a cheap beef weiner in a wonder bread roll.
The difference was the toppings, and thats what a Chicago hot dog is all about! 
It had a small amount of tomato, pickle, peppers and mustard on it.  And I loved the fresh taste they gave it. Much crisper than heavy chili or cheese! My only desire would have been for it to have a heavier helping of the toppings, and in fact when I go back (which I will!) I'm going to request a foolish amount of toppings, I recomend anyone trying it for the first time, just dive right in and join me in ordering extra toppings, after all, thats the point of this style of dog!
I ordered a chicago-style tamale because I had no idea such things existed. What I got was a microwave meat tamale that was indeed made in Chicago.
It was just a sad, sad beast. I'm sure it's a famous Chicago food, and beloved, and if I was raised there I would crave it, but to me, it was flavorless, soggy in the wrong way, and existed only so that people could drench it in chili and cheese, probably a hit at 7-11's, but not for me.
However, at about $1, I was willing to try it, and glad I did, however I shall not be having that one again.
 
We ordered 3 fries, and two would have done! They load those baskets up! 
I would ask for them well done next time, just because I like a slightly crispier fry, but that a minor quibble, zero complains on the fries!
Or anything, $15 for a mess of food, cooked to order, by a locally owned shop that cares. I'll certainly go back.

They also sell Gyro's, which I didn't try, even though I've been longing for a great gyro, and Italian sausage and steak sandwiches. I want to try those next.","3FkwIqBgu7dCv9pFQRTBDg",4,"2009-06-16",2,"review",0

But just because I've heard quite a few comments about the quality of the donut or whatever, I thought I'd share my googling on the subject (maybe this is all common knowledge but maybe you haven't read this yet). As of 2002, the chain moved from having the stores ditch all in-store baking equipment in favour of microwaves. The donuts are partially baked in a plant in Brantford and shipped frozen to be microwaved on site throughout the day. So if you used to like Tim Horton's donuts and can't figure out why you don't like them so much any more that is why.

Also the ""homemade"" chicken noodle soup that they serve at lunch is definitely powdered and rehydrated. One bite of the shrivelled peas and carrots in the soup and it is obvious. But in Toronto, there really aren't that many alternative options for donuts and the product, if nothing else, is consistent so if you are okay with it then you are okay with it.","GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow",2,"2008-10-29",1,"review",0

Wir hatten den Artikel in der Stuttgarter Zeitung gelesen und dachten das schauen wir uns mal an - und wir müssen sagen es hat sich gelohnt. Sehr gutes Essen, toller Service und eine beachtliche Weinkarte - nicht schlecht.
Bedienung
Aufmerksamer, unaufdringlicher Service - tolle Weinberatung vom Patron. Wir hatten echt die Qual der Wahl bei der Weinauswahl - all unsere Lieblingsweingüter waren vertreten: JJ Prüm, Egon Müller, Fritz Becker & besonders tolle Burgunderauswahl. Tolle Idee nur als die schwäbische Variante von Bordeauxweinen die Weingüter von Graf Neipperg aufzunehmen.
Das Essen
Da wir uns nicht wirklich bei den Vorseisen entscheiden konnten, schlug uns der nette Servicemitarbeiter die Vorspeisenvariation vor. Es war der Querschnitt aller Vorspeisen und einem kleinem Kürbissüppchen. Tolle Vorspeisen und ganz toll auf einer Etagere angerichtet. Wirklich sehr schmackhaft - mein absoluter Favorit war die hausgemachte bzw wie uns der Patron selber ""erfundene"" Maultaschen-Schwarzwurst-Terrine. So was in der Art hatte ich noch nie - einsamme Klasse! Beim Hauptgang waren wir bunt gemischt - ich hatte die Bouillabaise welche wirklich die Beste die ich ausserhalb Frankreichs gegessen hatte. Alle anderen waren auch begeistert von 2x Ochsenbacken und 1x Zwiebelrostbraten mit handgeschabten Spätzle - wirklich lecker !! Sehr gutes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis !!

Durch Zufall bei einem Stuttgartbesuch haben wir das Restaurant entdeckt. Hat wohl erst seit ca. 2 Wochen geöffnet. Haben wirklich sehr gut gegessen und was mich als Weinliebhaber freut - eine tolle Weinkarte mit endlich einmal vernünftigen Preisen !! Absolut sensationell.....Hätte am liebsten alle getrunken! Besonders auch die Jahrgangstiefe macht Spaß - eben keine 0815-Karte wo es den aktuellen Jahrgang gibt und das wars. Karte ca. 220-250 Positionen mit Schwerpunkt Deutschland und Burgund - aber auch noch sehr schöne Weine aus Italien, Spanien & Österreich.

Das Essen
Tolle regionale Küche. Hatten die Vorspeisenvariation - alle Vorspeisen plus kleines Süppchen. War eine tolle Etagere, liebevoll angerichtet und Geschmacklich super ! Besonders war der ""Schwäbische Nicoise"" mit Forelle und die hausgemachte ""Maultschen-Schwarzwurst-Terrine"" mit Kürbis-Senf-Chutney - also so was hab ich vorher noch nie gegessen - wirklich genial. Im Hauptgang ein ""Bouillabaise"" mit verschiedenen Fischfilets und einer dezent Knoblauch angehauchten Sauce Rouille - selten eine bessere gegessen! Zum Abschluß gab es noch ein Schwarzwälder Kirschdessert mit einem himmlischen Schokoladeneis - das Eis alleine war schon eine Sensation !!

Wir hatten uns sehr auf den Abend im Brust oder Keule gefreut und waren nach der guten Bewertung gespannt dieses neue Lokal zu erkunden. Wir reservierten telefonisch einen Tisch auf 18:30 Uhr und wurden am Telefon darauf hingewiesen spätestens um 20:45 Uhr den Tisch für nachfolgende Gäste verlassen zu müssen.
Wir bestellten alle vier das 3-Gang Menü und waren uns sicher, dass das Zeitfenster von )2 Stunden hierfür ausreichen müsse. Leider wurde die Weinbestellung erst entgegengenommen, als wir bereits fertig mit der Vorspeise waren. Der Hauptgang ließ auf sich warten und auch mit dem Teller abräumen klappte es leider nicht, so dass wir eine halbe Stunde warteten bis diese abgeräumt wurden.
Bis uns die Karte für den Nachtisch wieder überreicht wurde dauerte es weitere 15 Minuten. Glücklich darüber, dass wir endlich die Aufmerksamkeit des Kellners hatten, wollten wir unmittelbar bestellen. Dazu kam es leider nicht, denn ein weiterer Angestellter wies uns darauf hin, dass die nachfolgenden Gäste bereits da seien und wir jetzt zum Ende kommen müssen. Wir entgegneten höflich, dass wir das 3-Gang Menü bestellt und noch keinen Nachtisch hatten - daraufhin verschwand dieser, um den Chef zu holen.
Der Chef wies uns darauf hin, dass er da nichts machen könne - wir hätten zu lange gebraucht und müssten jetzt gehen - es sei schließlich angekündigt gewesen, dass wir den Tisch um 20:45 verlassen müssen. Als wir auf die verschiedenen Lappalien des Abends hinwiesen (s.u.) schnaubte uns dieser sehr unfreundlich an und betonte, dass der Fehler hier nicht bei ihm liege.
Nach kurzem Verschwinden tauchte der Chef erneut auf und wir verständigten uns darauf auf den Nachtisch zu verzichten - er bringe uns stattdessen ein Glas Champagner. Da uns der Hunger auf den Nachtisch ohnehin vergangen war willigten wir ein und schlugen sogar vor den Champagner an der Bar zu trinken, damit sich die bereits wartenden Gäste setzen können.
Die Krönung kam mit der Rechnung der volle Preis des Menüs wurde berechnet, obwohl wir keinen Nachtisch hatten. Als wir den Kellner darauf hinwiesen machte uns der Chef deutlich, dass er die Positionen auch einzeln berechnen könne, aber dass uns dies mit Sicherheit nicht günstiger kommen würde. Den Champagner hätten wir schließlich anstelle des Nachtischs erhalten. Keiner an unserem Tisch hatte dies so verstanden, vielmehr waren wir waren uns einig, dass der Champagner uns als Wiedergutmachung suggeriert wurde.
Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass das gute Essen leider keineswegs über den grauenhaften Service und die miserable Behandlung der Gäste hinweg hilft.

Bedienung
- Weinbestellung wurde erst aufgenommen als die Vorspeise gegessen war - da wir im Vorfeld kein Aperetif hatten leider eine trockene Angelegenheit.
- Die Flasche Wasser wurde im Regal ggü. unseres Platzes abgestellt - jedoch wurde nie vom Kellner nachgeschenkt, da dieser allein ca. 20-25 Gäste bediente. Letzlich holten wir uns die Flasche eigenhändig wieder zurück an den Tisch. Der Chef tat dies später ab mit dem Kommentar: 'Hier hilft der Gast mit'.
- Die Teller wurden nach dem Hauptgang erst nach einer halben Stunde abgeräumt.
- Immer wieder versuchten wir dem Kellner zu zeigen, dass wir gerne den Nachtisch bestellen würden, aber dieser war vollkommen überfordert mit der Anzahl der Gäste.
- sehr unfreundlicher Umgangston des Chefs



Das Essen
Wir hatten uns für das 3-Gang Menü entschiede: Zur Vorspeise wählten wir u.a. den gratinierten Ziegenkäse auf Roter Beete und zum Hauptgang u.a. Coq au Vin und Beeftartar. Beides war sehr fein und jeder am Tisch war mit seiner Bestellung außerordentlich zufrieden. Da der Kellner uns keine Weinempfehlung aussprechen konnte warteten wir auf die Empfehlung des Chefs. Leider wurde unsere Bestellung erst aufgenommen, als wir bereits fertig mit der Vorspeise waren. Über den Nachtisch kann ich leider nicht sagen, obwohl ich zu gerne den Ofenschlupfer probiert hätte.

Nachdem wir von dem Brust oder Keule gehört hatten, wollten wir das neue Restaurant ausprobieren und hatten uns auf einen schönen Abend gefreut. Nachdem unverschämten Auftritt des Chefs sind wir leider schlecht gelaunt nach Hause gegangen. Alles in allem kann ich das Restaurant nicht weiterempfehlen und würde es auch nicht  wieder besuchen.
Bedienung
Unser Keller war sehr freundlich und zu Scherzen aufgelegt. Leider endete damit auch schon der Service. Um zu bestellen musste man den Keller regelrecht abpassen und an den Tisch winken. Beim Bezahlen - meine Rechnung hat 50€ betragen - mussten wir uns vom Chef anhören:"" Die kleinste Rechnung des Abends und dann auch noch getrennt und mit Karte bezahlen wollen."" Wir hatten zuvor mitbekommen, dass die Gäste am Nachbartisch vor ihrem Nachtisch, trotz Bestellung des Menüs, das Restaurant verlassen musste, da die nächsten Gäste warten und ebenfalls den Service montiert hatten. Nachdem der Chef des Hauses auch hier die Gäste mit seinem Verhalten verärgert hat, hat sein finaler Auftritt an unserem Tisch den negativen Eindruck abgerundet.
Das Essen
Der Zwiebelrostbraten war gut zubereitet, aber relativ fettig. Die Beilagen und die anderen Gerichte (Gemüsestrudel/Bouillabaisse) waren gut.

Great for dogs with the large open area next to the property and the nature preserve behind it. The pool and hot tub are nice, we actually used the BBQ area, and the exercise room is pretty nice, too. The best part about Barossa is the staff. Stacey, Ron and team really, really impress me. They've gone out of their way for me numerous times and it's obvious they take great pride in the community. I'll be frank, no property is perfect, especially if you fail to keep in context this is an apartment complex with a lot of people living in a small space. Sure, I've hear my neighbors a few times, the parking can get tight on the weekends, but keep it all in perspective. Rent is reasonable, it's all new and very modern/attractive, you're right in N.

Unit: I lived in the bottom floor unit the entire term of the lease. Immediately there was a problem in the fact that there were no lights on the ceiling fans... not sure if that's the standard but come on. I bought my own and installed them, problem fixed. The unit was beautiful with very high ceilings, granite counter tops, and hardwood floors. Layout was ""ok"" I kind of had a gripe with my kitchen table being in the way of everything, but the table was a bit large (square). Other than that, the kitchen was kind of small but lots of storage space, full side-by-side washer/dryer, and a good sized closet despite not being a walk-in. Build quality was probably 3.5/5 stars if I had to rate.

Garage: Garage was tiny, my 328i barely fit, not sure how some people fit their larger cars, let alone some SUV's. Once in a while I would see a vehicle that just wouldn't fit and it's butt/nose would be sticking out. Detached, but not too far from my unit.

Parking: Visitor parking was super-volatile throughout the 3 year period. I purposely got a unit near the open visitor parking area as I didn't want any visitors to my place have to walk far just to park (omg so annoying). Sometimes it would be empty for weeks and sometimes it would be so packed that you'd see cars parked outside the complex along the street illegally, but it's not like they really had any other choice, unless they parked illegally somewhere else.

Amenities: I didn't use much of the small pool or the gym (small complex, so it didn't really need large pool), but they had BBQ grills outside and a Jacuzzi to complement the pool.

Neighbors: This is purely from my experience, and some things the apartment just can't control. Near the end of my 3rd year lease, I had some really disgusting neighbors. Trash near their apartment, packaging materials sprawled out in the walking area, and one time someone emptied their vacuum onto the small gravel area right near everyone's walkway (disgusting!!). Noise was a bit of an issue, as my upstairs neighbors (3 different families/couples) that lived above me were not aware that they lived above someone else - quite the stompers; I did not complain as my lease was ending anyways, but a definite factor on my decision to terminate the lease. Another was the pet issue - in my last few months there it was very clean and well controlled, but the majority of the time there were pet droppings that weren't cleaned up and I had to complain to the front office (once again not the apt's fault, irresponsible pet owners).

Wildlife: There were some critters out there over the 3 years, from a baby bat, to a baby rattlesnake (scary! but no harm done), some crazy looking spiders, but the apartment did a good job of keeping them out of my unit.

Office Staff: Through my 3 year tenure at Verde (Barossa at first), the office staff changed quite a bit, and none were bad nor awesome, except Nicole who was one of the best but I do not believe she was there by the time my lease had ended.

Overall, my experience was a decent one, what you'd typically expect from apartment living. Would I recommend it? Sure, if you pay the rent that they are offering now vs what I paid for when I first moved in and paid for until I moved out. :)","61p5SFWk-sL_d-9FoRUksg",3,"2014-12-16",6,"review",0

Compared to other apartment complex reviews that I've seen about unfriendly staff, Verde wins this. With such a small number of apartments they can actually get things done in a timely manner, including maintenance requests, although the only requests I've had are my lightbulbs.

I live in the A1 floorplan and coming from NYC this place feels huge, it may not feel that way for you. I have a rug and no balcony and I paid in the mid 800s but that was in July, prices go up in the winter. One thing to note is you will be taxed on your rent which is an additional $15/month for me + water, sewage, garbage, which is another $20 or so, keep that in mind, either I wasn't told that when I was looking or I wasn't paying attention. 

During the summer my electric bill was around $85 (I'm a stickler when it comes to electricity and running my A/C, I kept my apartment at 82 during the day and 74 at night. I assume if you have it running all day you'll get hit pretty hard. The ceiling fans are nice and help a bit. I haven't run my A/C much in November and I believe my bill was around $40.

The pool area is small and gets shady pretty quickly and the walls are a bit thing, but I'm on the third floor, I can hear a dog barking in the apartment next to me, but that's what you get with apartment living. My apartment is dusty, I keep the windows open, so you'll need a vacuum if you get an apartment with a rug, if I had known the amount of dust that's in AZ i may have splurged for hardwood. The workout room is small but functional, I belong to the 24 hr fitness down the road and it's cheap.

I do like living here and there's a very good chance I'll renew my lease in July.","61p5SFWk-sL_d-9FoRUksg",4,"2014-11-30",1,"review",0
"4777",2,"aATG_blb1GnInoEONEoQyw","cYaEt_9dfNAvZ_tmX2rXkg","Not really sure why Verde is listed on Yelp.  It's an apartment complex and not a hotel, something that we typically use ratings for when deciding on were to stay when we visit an area.  However, Verde is used by the Mayo Clinic (just right up the street) as their version of an extended-stay hotel for their residents and fellows, so that makes this place a inn for many people.

Anyway, Verde is a very nice, clean, and relaxing complex.  The employees at the front desk are very friendly and helpful (we had to visit them to pick up our packages dropped off by the post office).  They have a well-maintained, heated pool in the very center.  It includes a hot tub, a gazebo with a large flat-screen TV, and two gas grills.  The grills are very popular and, if you go a peek hours, you'll have to wait to cook your food.  The pool and hot tub are hardly used, so we basically had a private area to chill and enjoy the warm weather (Currently, it's snowing here, at the Rochester Mayo, while I'm writing this review).

The complex is very convenient.  It's location is only 15-20minutes (depending on traffic, which may take twice as long during rush hours) from just about anywhere you'd want to go in Scottsdale.  For Mayo, it is less than a 5minute drive and there is never any traffic that direction.

We only have a few complaints about Verde:  1) The hallways (each room has a small suite area in the front for four other doors) are very noisy.  Our neighbors slammed their doors constantly and we could here them argue often.  If you're watching TV, it can be distracting.  2) Verde is gated.  Some people may find this feature comforting.  However, we just found it silly and a waste of time.  Any one that wants drive into the complex just has to park and wait for someone else to punch the code in.  The code opens two doors and they stay open long enough for any one with a little patience free entry.  3)  We had a very difficult time finding the recycle bin.  Verde has only one bin (there are two trash areas and the one closer to our room didn't have a receptacle) and it isn't clearly marked.  In fact, I  noticed a lot of people tossed non-recyclables in there too.  Plus, the bin does not accept glass (I'm not sure if Phoenix recycles glass though).","61p5SFWk-sL_d-9FoRUksg",4,"2016-03-24",1,"review",1

I told her it was very salty and I still had an awful salty taste in my mouth.

Wir saßen übrigens unten in der Cantina, da sieht es am modernsten aus, und ruhig war es auch.

Letztendlich soll es wohl so eine Art italienischer Schicki  Micki  Treff sein, ein Restaurant ist es jedoch ganz sicher nicht. Oben keine Sitzplätze, nur Stehtische, unten keine vernünftigen Tische und auch keine vernünftigen Stühle, sondern unpraktischer und ungemütlicher Designerkram. Von einer Speisekarte kann man wirklich nicht sprechen, denn es gibt als Hauptgericht lediglich 3 Sorten Pasta (darunter 1 Sorte Spagetti), 1 Sorte Risotto, 1 Sorte Gnocchi und eine Art Flammkuchen, das war's dann wirklich auch schon, mehr gibt es tatsächlich nicht ! Restaurant geht schon ein weinig anders ! Dennoch hatte ich die Spagetti bestellt und obwohl es nur genau EINE Sorte Spagetti gab, hat der vollkommen überforderte Kellner 3 x nachgefragt, welche Spagetti ich eigentlich wolle. Auf neine Nachfrage, ob es noch andere Spagetti  Sorten gäbe, gab er keine Antwort. Dazu habe ich als Getränk ein kleines Wasser bestellt, was mit eigenartigen Blicken und wieder mehrfachem Nachfragen des Kellners , ob ich wirklich ein Kleines Wasser wolle kommentiert wurde, offenbar sollen dort die im Gegensatz zum Essen in Massen angebotenen Weine vorrangig an den Mann gebracht werden! Nach 10 Minuten war weder ein Getränk, noch eine ebenfalls bestellte Tomatensuppe noch irgendeines der 3 bestellten Pastagerichte da, anstelle dessen wurden 3 weitere fremde Personen an unseren Tisch gesetzt. Als die dann auch etwas bestellen wollten kam die Mitteilung, dass es 30 bis 45 Minuten dauern würde, wenn man essen wolle  WIE BITTE ? Für gerade einmal 5 einfache Pasta/Risotto  Angebote die es auf der Speisekarte gibt auch noch 45 Minuten warten ?
Wir haben unsere Bestellung storniert und sind tief enttäuscht gegangen.

Right off the bat, I was pleased to see more than four people behind the counter go accommodate the lunch rush. And to see that each was given a specific task. There was an order taker, a meat and cheese expert, a veggies topper and a cashier. Then there was even a runner filling up the (veggie and bread) stations and getting whatever anyone needed. Clearly, I made up all these titles but you get the idea. Everyone knew their role and it worked out so well for everyone (staff and customers)....especially during a busy lunch rush. 

I opted for their new $4, $5 or $6 lunch special where you get a 6 inch sub (tons of options) and drink. My sandwich was prepared correctly, plenty of fresh veggies just like I like and everyone was super nice, they made sure I had everything I needed before I left...including my cookies.

It's a great spot any time of year for taking photographs. You'll find swans building nest in the spring time, and kids skating on the ice in the winter. And speaking of, you'll find a make-shift hockey surf cleared away on the frozen ice in the winter and usually skating paths all around the pond. In the summer, you'll see people fishing all over the place.

Along the Queensway, you'll find a few benches that sit at the edge of the pond, which are great for relaxing as you take in the scenery. You can continue into High Park, and walk along the edge of the pond all the way up. During winter months, or very early mornings, you won't find many people around, and it can really feel like you're away hiking.

During the warmer months, the area around the pond can get quite busy, starting with the cherry blossom trees blooming in the spring. This of course brings a ton of garbage, although people tend to be more respectful than they are when they're downtown (when it comes to throwing away their trash properly).

The best spots for fishing are immediately north of the little dock in the middle of the pond and anywhere north of that along the narrow part of the pond.

The best times to go are at dawn and dusk and before August, when the weeds become unbearable.

I was a public school success and had my reservations about private school. Now I have none. PVCP has been great to become involved with. I'm introverted but still actually enjoy being involved. The freedom of knowledge is unbeatable,  they don't have lawmakers telling them what they can and can't do. And don't think it's one sided either, when we toured the school the kids were learning about dinosaurs,  yes at a Christian school.  Are they teaching creationism at non-christian schools?

We are now friends with parents from Iran, Nigeria, and Columbia, again cool!

"4817",2,"asL1d04xS3y8YQtU5ota-g","QjBT2x3rymk2UTlbdeNEDA","This review is based on how well the school prepared their past students for high school. My son just went to 8th grade there. 
It seemed like a majority of the kids started at a very young age and goes there through junior high. Saying this, the school has one method and one method of teaching which I would say is not good for the student. The students will struggle once they leave the school cause they only understand one method. 
My son was in the lowest pre-algebra class. He was struggling with the method because all the other kids grew up learning this method. The teacher Mr. Bitter even told our son that he shouldn't go into Algebra 1-2 in high school. Well he went into public high school and struggled a little but nothing a tutor couldn't help him with. He's now doing really well in Geometry. Another former student that was in the same grade as my son was in honor math. Anyways, they are now both in public school and the same Geometry class. My son is doing better than the junior high honor student. 
Also, another former junior high student from the school was a honor student and went to the same public high school. After two weeks of school she was failing classes and moved back to PVCP for high school. This shows that they did not prepare the kids for high school. 
My son is in honors Spanish 3-4 at the public school. He said that the 8th grade Spanish teacher was teaching the same thing as he is learning now in honors 3-4. This tells me the teacher doesn't know how to progress the students correctly. Don't just push them through a class but learn to teach. 
So overall, I feel that this school does NOT prepare the kids for high school or college correctly. It was a big mistake to send my kid there. Save your money and send them to public school. If your worried about Christian values then teach them at home. That's what parents are there for. It's not the schools responsibility to teach these values.","6wtcXGUdg3q3bumGcaqJYQ",1,"2013-05-18",2,"review",2

This school doesn't just use the title ""christian school"" this school is just as serious about academics as growing the kids in their relationship with the Lord. I truly think this is a treasure and i would love to share the experience with all my friends. If you are thinking about a change for next year, go visit before schools out, you have to see the kids there with the teachers to experience God's presence in this school!! With 3 kids in this school all with different academic abilities and personalities this school has been a great fit for all of them. Academically kids are pushed. If your child needs extra help a tutor will meet with them, also teachers have homework help times after school to work with kids. If your chid is gifted they will be placed in honors classes and be expected to perform!  I have kids at both extremes and know this first hand. My only downfall with this school is that after school programs are limited in the early grades. However, the school is always open to suggestions and if parents have a desire to start something I know from experience the school makes the time and the space. I feel like at this school a lot of the kids go to club sports, private lessons, etc so the school has tried but many of these kids are already spread thin after school.  We have been there for several years and I know from reviewing the national testing that my kids do every year that all 3 kids are at or way above grade level (even my child that struggles.) Your child will be pushed but PVCC believes in their students and they will provide the means to build confidence in the kids and to help them be successful and to grow in their abilities so the kids can stand on their own to be successful in later academic endeavors.","6wtcXGUdg3q3bumGcaqJYQ",5,"2014-04-29",1,"review",1

The first week I dropped my kids off I was scared to death, new city, new school...but someone met me every day and let me know they looked in on my kids and how they were doing.  The office staff knows my kids names, they know what kind of day they are having, they know our family.  I am not only confident that my children are safe when I leave them but they are also LOVED!!!  The teachers are wonderful, loving and supportive.  I have not had a complaint with ANY of them.  Not only that but my kids are getting the highest level education that I could ask for.  Small class sizes, ability to move up when needed, ability to move down if needed.  My kids love it and have never looked back.  It is worth your time to drop by and take a look!!!

When we transferred them in from a local Catholic school, my 2nd grader was behind the rest of the class in math and reading. I cannot say enough about how great 2nd grade teacher, Mrs. Corbin, helped him with her strict but encouraging way that brought him up to speed and beyond by the second half of the year. She never made him feel badly for being behind, and she never made us worrying parents feel like there was any problem. He became the reader he is today, and the advanced math student he is enjoying as a middle schooler. Our 4th grader has had the past 5 years in a positive, encouraging, academically challenging atmosphere. If you have a kid who is going to fall in the middle of the pack academically, better to send him to a school like PVCP where the ""middle"" is set at a standard above any public school, and strives to help each kid reach his greatness.","6wtcXGUdg3q3bumGcaqJYQ",5,"2015-03-27",0,"review",0

I told her I was unavailable March18th- 26th (which happened to be the coldest/rainiest days) and I wanted photos before he turned 9 months. We talked about doing both indoor and outdoor as I wanted to show off his baby rolls and also see him dressed outdoors.  He's never had prof photos dones so I wanted a full range. She said her schedule was ""wide open and we shouId wait for a weather appropriate day in the next couple weeks"" (her exact words). That is, early March.  I emailed her on Mar 2nd to coordinate. I watched the weather everyday and appropriate days passed. I figured she'd email me!?  On Mar 13th she surprises me to say she was in FL until the 26th and was available late March. Though later she admitted being in Charlotte on the 15th?!  That's a big chunk of unavailable time she never mentioned!!!!  On March 15th we scheduled a session for Wed the 27th (baby's 9 month b-day). I was leery as her replies were delayed and I didn't hear from her to confirm our appointment.

Mar 13th her email begins ""I apologize for my delayed response"" to my Mar 2nd email
Mar 19th her email begins ""Hi Tricia! Sorry for my delay...in FL!"" to my Mar 13th email.

The morning of the appt. I receive an email saying her husband was called unexpectedly out of town for business and her baby sitter fell through.  Not much notice... especially since I prepared on my side. New date Sat the 30th.

Then my son caught a cold and I sent the following email Fri the 29th:

""I wish we had done the photo session during the first couple weeks of March (before my Dad arrived) like we initially discussed over the phone.  I had no idea you were going out of town during that time. Now, baby boy has a cold and his nose is running.  Not an attractive look for professional photos. Perhaps, it will clear up by tomorrow morning - I will let you you.  I have needed to get his photos done and it's been put off for too long now. - Tricia""

At least I showed some respect for her time.  Her fastest reply ever.... ""You seem quite unhappy at this point and I feel you would be more comfortable if you hired another photographer.""  I asked her to reconsider (against my better judgment) - after waiting all this time I dreaded having to start all over!  Didn't hear back so I want to forewarn potential clients.  A true professional would have said, ""Don't worry! We'll get it done ASAP and it will be fabulous!""

Shannon told me ""I do photography for the love of it, not the money so when I come across a client who isn't happy even before the session...we part ways."" 

If this is only a hobby, she shouldn't call it a business and stick to photographing family and friends.

I was misled. She doesn't want or care about the work.

I waited a month for nothing. And that's like a year in infant time.","AXWWSxeM8v24-RKA62xG7Q",1,"2013-03-29",2,"review",0

The stylist was very kind and easy to talk to, but she never asked me if the highlights were what I wanted.  I brought in a picture (of Lauren Conrad with very beachy/natural highlights), and told her that I wanted something like that - or at least something that looked very natural (it was my wedding after all).  What I got was a chunk of bleached hair in the front starting almost at the roots, but not quite.  The highlights were the exact opposite of everything that I asked for - looking very unnatural and lighter at the top instead of the bottom.  As she blew dry my hair she just kept saying how wonderful they looked and never gave me the opportunity to address my concerns.  I don't feel comfortable telling someone that I don't like something they did unless they ask something along the lines of ""Is this what you were thinking?""  I've just never had my hair done before when someone didn't ask my opinion, and this was for my wedding, which she knew, as we talked about it several times.  Long story short, we were leaving for the beach the next day (the wedding was in NC), so I went home and called studios to see if anyone could fit me in to address the issue - which of course being a Saturday, they couldn't.  I ended up getting recommendations for someone at the beach - she helped me so much (after a weekend of tears and pulling my hair back and contemplating just dying it one color).  She also validated my concerns.  I know that hairdressers critique each other's work frequently, but when she asked me when I had them done (3 days prior) and said that it looked like they were done 6 weeks ago, I knew that I wasn't making up this issue (many, many parts - including highlights next to my face - had what looked like 1/2 inch roots).  I'm just frustrated that I paid so much money to have something done that I disliked so much without ever being asked if I was happy with the end-result and then had to pay more money to correct the issue.  I also felt like not only was I displeased, but the work was not well done or up to any standard.  I definitely learned my lesson on going to someone I don't know before a big event.

Also, after trying to contact the salon to voice my concerns, they never responded to me.","5gndRta9bccG0I8gKJecbA",2,"2012-08-02",5,"review",0

I have bought some interesting things here, including a homemade piggy bank.  I have no use at all for a homemade piggy bank, but it was so cute.

The cut is always great.  I change the type of cut according to the seasons.  They always keep up with my change requests.  

I had older dogs that were fear based.  They always took extra care with him.  They are booked during the winter months.  It may take a few days to get in.  After April, it's easy to get an appointment. 

The wash Goddess Angie is the BEST.  Our dogs spend a good amount of time in Angie's care.  She is so good with the dogs and is excellent at her job.

I can speak first hand that the owner Donna, is honest, ethical and professional.

They have had great groomers, and not so great.  I know they have had a turn over, and I think I know why.   Tips are an important part of the groomers pay.   In Sun City West, were they are located, will not tip.  I usually tip $5.00 to groomer and $5.00 to bather.   The last time I was there my budget was was short, I apologized that $2.00 each is all I could give.   They were delighted with my tip, telling me how bad it was.  

Groomers make more tips outside of Sun Cities.   This explains why it coast so much at Grand Grooming, they have to keep raising their fees to keep the good groomers, as will as rising expenses.

I have wondered why it is so easy now to get an appointment.  I used to have to make appointments weeks in advance, now it is 1 to 2 days.   I blame NOT Grand Grooming owner, but her customer bass.  If each of them could cough up $2.00 ($1.00 ea.), or $4.00 (better), good groomers would probably stay.    

Granting what the gentle man said is true, no matter ware you go you take a chance.  Grand Grooming management dose care, that is very important.  I have no problem in sending friends to them, nor suggesting they leave a tip.  Help them keep good groomers, by tipping and knowing your groomer.  I used the same person for years, I now know why she is not there any longer.","AK4FuPTFWFRPxSyRxzwiNA",5,"2012-10-27",1,"review",0

No, really, everyone in this place is denying themselves the reality of their sexual ardor; from the c*ckhungry bouncers whose cheap Express suits are actually managing to drape their puny frames like a weakling gang of pin-striped Ciceros; to the hypersexulized female bartenders, who lend their primary attention to the fraction of the clientele NOT ordering drinks (erm, the women who are looking for men to buy their Strawberry-Guava-Valtrex Mojito).

The bar itself is sorta cool.  There is a long L-shaped bar and a decent prom-style dance floor, that puts the d*ckheads dancing on parade for your entertainment.  But, then there's that damn 90's inspired decor that f'ing Scottsdale can't seem to get over.  Freaking couches in the bar, man.  Are we supposed to feel important because we're sitting on a g'damn suede sofa drinking a mid-range scotch?

Overall, everything but the booze here sucks.  The f-faces out front actually made me and the wolfpack group of 4 dudes actually wait in an invisible line outside of the door for at least 20 minutes so that they 1) could teach us a lesson that 4 dudes should not be rolling solo to Scottsdale clubs (they were right, but we were meeting the rest of the group inside, which included females) 2) give the impression that their club was worth a shite (they were wrong) 3) compensate for years of penis torment with this new-found power while making $8 an hour plus whatever crappy tips the bartenders decide to admit to them that they made that night.

My friend ordered a glass of Vodka and Red Bull. The bartender said that it was $2 extra for Red Bull and she was fine with it. She said the drink was strong. She ordered another and closed her tab which was only a total of 4 bucks!!! How great is that! 

There was a good mix of people at the club. Met some interesting individuals. I'd definitely come back to check out the place again for the music and the next time around, I might want to buy a drink or two cuz it's so cheap!

A bar that was cool and trendy, but that wasn't playing the top 40 hip/hop and pop chart, but was willing to put themselves on the line and play some rock.

I'm not complaining, since I actually like PCL well enough.  I ventured into DP right when it first opened, so I'm hoping they have grown into themselves a bit since I've been in.  When I was there, the DJ was effing AWESOME...  I couldnt get enough of his 80s rock/current hip hop beats, but then hed switch up to something like Sublime.  Now, dont get me wrong, I do like modern rock but not when everyones attempting to dance to hip hop.  People dont know what to do with themselves.  And thats a lot of what happened on the dance floor the night I was there.  A lot of standing around and looking at people.  PCL anyone?  hehe

Clientele is Scottsdale snobby which I do appreciate, with a mix of randoms...but like I said, maybe that was just in the first month or so,  maybe recently others have filtered themselves out of DP and back to Dos.    

They have a photo booth towards the back of the bar, which I think is a freaking great idea...  Even though we all have digitals, theres something about paying $5 for below par photos of you and the hot guy from Minnesota you've been making out with all night.  Again, am I wrong?  I am not.

The music started out pretty good. Top 40 dance music mixed in with a little something different every 3 or 4 songs. Only complaint about the DJ is that he was super ADD and only played like 20 seconds of a song and then changed it. Take your Adderall man and play the *entire* Single Ladies song so I can dance with my girlfriends!

I like the atmosphere but the dance floor was pretty small. The crowd was a good mix and drinks were reasonably priced. Best part was that I met some pretty interesting characters including Nostrovia Russia Free Shot Dude, the Tallest Man in the World, and capped it off with Mr. White Man Can't Dance. Ah, the memories.

Does it seem weird that I *really* loved the bathroom? The sign on the door of the ""ladies"" room said Sexy Bitches (see photo) and the best part is that there was not one, but TWO towel valets for a 3 stall bathroom. Really folks? I can tear off my own paper towel, but thanks. The valets were very sweet though considering what they probably have to deal with in a typical evening. 

So yeah, this place was pretty great for a no pressure night out to dance.","9SZjh75TGnyFjRUWUzPEuQ",4,"2010-01-11",6,"review",3

However... lord help me, I had a good time (even though I couldn't leave fast enough). We got there before 11 on a Friday which is apparently early enough because there was no line to wait in and no cover to pay. The place was relatively empty and we were able to order drinks right away.

The service was good and everyone was sweet to us. Everyone in the place was young, well dressed and attractive. It didn't quite seem as douchey as I've been lead to believe. It just seemed like a bunch of young people having a good time. I expected to see more Affliction shirts than I did, but there were some. 

A large group showed up wearing golfing attire - this is apparently some new college thing that I'm too old to know about. They seemed to be having a blast dancing like fools. I honestly felt like the place wasn't trying quite as hard as other places in the area... there was just something a little genuine about it that set it apart. 

The drinks were expensive, the music was loud, the place was dark, and there was a VIP area. If you're a hot girl and you want to get dressed up and go dancing - you could do worse than here. If you're a young guy and you want to dance with some hot girls, you could also do worse. 

It's totally not my kind of place, but I can't see a reason to say it's a fucking horrible experience. I mean, if what they're peddling is what you are looking for - this place is great. 

I hate it and I probably won't be back. It deserves 4 stars though for being only mildly pretentious and for providing a solid place where people can apparently have a good time. I'm giving this 4 stars, but I had trouble deciding between that and 2 stars. I may revise this review at a later date.","9SZjh75TGnyFjRUWUzPEuQ",4,"2008-08-16",6,"review",2

Maybe it's the fact that when I come here I usually like to sit at the tables in front of the bar as you walk in, which is less crowded and away from most of the action, but I've always felt pretty comfortable here. 

I was here this past Friday when I was in town visiting. When one of my friends suggested we start the night here I was actually pretty excited thinking about all of the fun times that we've had here in the past (and we have had some INTERESTING nights that have involved this place). Not much has changed in the last year (it has been about that long since I had last been here), which was a good thing. 

The bartenders are still quick with drink orders, the bouncers can actually carry a conservation with you (which is rare in Scottsdale), and although this place does have it's share of douches it's nothing compared to Myst, Axxis, or PCL (I feel like a douche just typing that acronym).

in late May. While there's no denying that the bar is hot, the crowd is a big turnoff. You'll find your typical ""Scottsdale"" crowd -- plastic surgery enhanced women and guys with faux-hawks and popped collars wearing bandanas around their wrists. 

I love the club but the people are nauseating and make me want to click my heels three times to return home.

If you can get past the clueless Scottsdale crowd, you may very well enjoy the bar, which is more of a club than a rock club. Ornate chandeliers hang from the ceiling of the dimly lit space, which is run by the owners of Scottsdale's Pussycat Lounge. A DJ spins hip-hop and rock mash-ups as people can be found mingling on plush sofas or throughout the bar.

I would come back to Chix and order just a couple of sides of chicken instead of ordering a plate next time.","7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ",5,"2010-04-06",0,"review",0

The food is delicious and convenient. Their bowls are the perfect size and not pricey at all (even better for students). You can get bowls or plates with chicken, rib eye, pork you name it!

They have a very limited menu: rice (white and brown), veggies, beef, and chicken.  That's about it.  But, of what they do have, I will say: good flavor, good quality, cooked well and very reasonably priced.  ""The Works"" plate I ordered was only $6.50 and it was huge.  The beef was rib-eye (one of the tastiest cuts of meat in my opinion) and it, along with the chicken, were perfectly grilled.  Not undercooked, not overcooked, tender and moist.  Also, I was impressed by the fact that they offered both white and brown rice.  Comparable places only offer white rice.  Sometimes, its those little things that make a difference.  

If you liked Mai Island Grill, but not the price, the crowd, the line, or their hours, then you will most likely like Chix.  Personally, if Chix added a tasty mac salad, I would say it would serve as a suitable replacement for Mai Island.","7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ",4,"2010-09-26",0,"review",0
"4920",0,"df_wr-hXaxeb1b_KCAX3BA","g04nDQOnRd-J3GlEdxH0Mw","I can describe this place in four words: simple, healthy, delicious, and inexpensive!

I love this place. I'll start with the simple part. You can either order plates or bowls. The plates are the same as the bowls, but plus a side of salad and the fresh local fruit they have that day. As for the structure of the bowls, you can get some combination of meat, vegetables, and rice. For rice, you can choose between white and brown. The vegetables are just an assortment of the standard vegetables. The meat is either chicken or ribeye meat.

On to the healthy part: The rice is always steamed, never any oil, etc. added into anything! No trans fats in any of their dishes! The meat is charbroiled, in order to maintain the oil-free thing. The skin is removed from all of the chicken to reduce the fat content. This is probably the healthiest option for food anywhere near ASU.

Delicious: The sauce that they have is great. I would say it's some kind of modification of a teriyaki sauce, and you can tell a lot of effort went into that sauce. They only have the one sauce, but it is a great one. They have a cajun-hot sauce on the side, also, in case you want to add a little heat, which I usually do. 

Inexpensive: The bowls are around $5.00. They don't look that big, but because they are so healthy, they will fill you up. 

The first week I tried this place, I went back 3 times (3 days in a row). I cannot get enough of this place and I will be back soon.","7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ",5,"2010-11-16",1,"review",1

"4926",8,"0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w","rFKSOlhm2JwrESI-1iLuxg","The last couple of weeks had been painful. A pain under the left heel had left a ligament that just last year carried me to the summit of Black Mountain, and on the city streets of Chicago was derelict. A ligament that had been so full of energy was a hindrance. A sprint through life had been replaced with a painful limp :'o(  After a few weeks in this condition (which included hiking), I finally came to the decision to see a Podiatrist. I turned to Yelp's podiatrist category. The reviews led me to Apache Foot & Ankle Specialist. 

  I took today off from work to see Dr. Lee Wittenberg (abbreviated Dr. W) in his St. Rose Parkway practice. I didn't even know he had an office here until I typed in the direct name (after putting in a duplicate listing that I won't use). This office might as well not exist considering that it is only open on Monday and Wednesday 9 to 12 pm and DOES NOT HAVE AN X-RAY MACHINE (I will repeat this later on). 

 I arrived in Apache Foot and Ankle Specialists at 9:45 to fill out the prerequisite paperwork for the visit. The receptionist was professional (too bad I could not say this about Dr. W, which I'll talk about soon). 

  The introduction to Dr. W's visit, is the receptionist seating me in a chair in back of her desk to measure my blood pressure. It was slightly high (runs on my dad's side of the family). She next led me into the patient's room. 

  Dr. W started out professional. He felt under my heel to diagnose the pain. I couldn't feel the pokes & mentioned  it hurt when he turned it. He diagnosed it as Plantar Fasciitis. The pain is from the bottom to the ball of my left foot. The Plantar Fasciitis is one of the major supports for holding up the medical arch of the foot. The next part of a Dr. W visit with a diagnosis of Plantar Fasciitis is building an orthodic arch for the heel. Dr. W's attitude from this point forward would be the Achilles Heel toward my relationship with his practice and word of mouth as expressed in my Yelp. 

   A generic health problem was the Green Reaper in Dr. W continuing directly with the treatment. I suffer from the same generic health condition that caused tremors to the left side of my mother and grandmother. God rest their souls. Dr. W turned  unprofessional . He asked me if I have Parkinson's Disease and I will raise my raise my right hand to Heaven that he actually said, ""Do you have any brain damage?"" ""Did you have a stroke? "" This is a moment that I felt my late mother's pain and would have embraced her with a hug if she was here (actually tearing writing this as I think over my mother's pain). The upshot is that Dr. W denied treating me until I see Neurology of Center of Nevada for a condition that I read there is no cure for. 

  Now the tears are being replaced by anger. Dr W's""Orthotics: Eyeglasses for your Feet,"" states the following : ""Orthotics are made in several ways. The patient may be asked to step into a  'foam box, ' which will make an impression of their foot. There is also a computerized version, where the patient stands on a plate and a computer program identifies areas of pressure. Both of these are taken in with the patient standing. "" So why didn't Dr. W have me stand up or strap my shaking left foot? Worst, there was no working x-ray machine in the office. My picture for this business listing shows that he passed on the buck to Pueblo Medical Imaging. I DID NOT TAKE OFF FROM WORK and Pay My DEDUCTABLE OUT of my POCKET To HAVE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR X-RAYS THAT IS A CORE RESPONSIBILITY OF A FOOT DOCTOR. Did I break a bone?  This is more critical than a neurotic condition passed on from my grandmother and mother. 

   I will give Dr. W one star (would of been zero stars) for the cortisone shot. When you suffer as much I did, the cortisone shot is a pinch. And a band aid approach! 

  Dr. W gave me the IMPRESSION that he was in a hurry to get to his Fort Apache Road practice. He gave me a cursory introduction to his stretching and icing instructions for Plantar Fasciitis. I will have to visit a more helpful source:YouTube, to gain an understanding of the exercises. He never said anything professional like,  ""Goodbye, I hope you feel better."" He never informed me if I am supposed to report to work which demands a lot of walking. "" I did leave with a lighter wallet paying the deductible. 

  Dr. Wittenberg's unprofessional attitude and failure to have the necessary equipment necessary in a podiatrist practice is the Achilles heel that prevents anything further than one star. Out of 621 reviews and countless check-ins he is the worst. The upshot is that immediately after this visit, I drove to Foot Solutions for arch supports. DeWitt was the antithesis of Dr. Wittenberg. If this does not work, I will make an appointment with a different podiatrist. I will kick my left foot through a lawn mower before visiting Apache Foot and Ankle.","8Me3FYlesJygPsiGccTzLA",1,"2014-11-13",11,"review",9

Their coffee is good and their food is good.  I've had espresso drinks, which were perfectly made, some of the food, and some of their medium roast coffees.

The only negative thing I have to say is that some of their pastries aren't the greatest, but as far as I can tell those are ordered in from somewhere else.  Their stuff made in house is fabulous.  Also, don't go here and order regular coffee if you're in a hurry on a Saturday, or even a late morning.

The Lattes here are always great, and it really seems like the barista/manager, Paul truly cares about giving you sa good drink for your hard earned cash. At $4.00 for a twenty oucne whole milk latte, its a great value. They use Girhadelli*(sp?) chocolate in their mochas, which are also awesome, and only $4.50 even for a twenty ounce. Thgey carry a full line of Rishi teas,greens,blacks,herbal,caf free, hot or iced,just specify. This is a really nice spot, and a great place to go relax in front of the fireplace in wintertime. Very quiet,very chill, very good quiet music, an overall 10. Good job Fitchburg for getting this place,lets hope you support it enough to keep it. :-) Also, it has free Wi-Fi,good pastries from La Brioche delevired daily, and homemade soups which are all vegetarian, and good. Soup is $4.00 and served with a big hunk of fesh sourdough bread. You can have it either there or to go. They also offer a bottomless cup of fresh brewed coffee for 2.75, and you can even leave and then come back later for another refill. If you bring your own mug/cup, you save $0.25 cents on any drink too,any day, all the time. Great deal for someone with some work to do on the laptop.

Here was my experience. Moms, your big  massage spa chair with jets in the water has been replaced by a warm bowl of water. There will be no buffing of calluses or cuticle repair. There will be strawberry/vanilla/chocolate scented exfoliating scrub. The nail polish is so cheap that you can see through it. On the bright side, you get to take a small bottle home. Your normal pedicure that you pay $45 that takes a hour will be replaced by a 15 min nail polish change that still costs $45. You will receive a small scoop of ice cream. However, when mine was served, it was completely melted. The nail lady apologized and said she was sorry it was so melted.I joked and asked for a straw. She didn't offer to replace it. I still haven't figured out why you would even serve melted ice cream.

Everyone wears pick robes, but the place is hot and my daughter complained that it was too warm to wear it.

If you're willing to pay extraordinary prices for a terrible polish change with a tierra, go here. If you'd like a real pedicure, so to the place in Hilldale.

Royal Paan Rexdale

Royal Paan Rexdale is our LAST stop for our November Food Crawl!

Royal Paan is in an area I hardly frequent.. especially at night! GPS took me to this strip plaza, the only one in the intersection that were packed with parked car. Smell of spices and curries so thick in the air....

I just cannot eat anymore...... KO for the night but then I saw a DVD store.. My Yelp Friend last stop is for me to look at  Bollywood DVDs? What were all these men doing lining up for what?

Paan is a tradition practice of chewing betel leafs with areca nut and slaked lime paste. Paan is claimed to be chewed as a palate cleanser, a breath freshener, and for digestive purposes.* That's sounded like a perfect ending to our Food Crawl....

But chewing leafs was the last thing I had in my mind when I saw all the pictures of Lassi and Falooda......

Royal Falooda ($3.49) 
- Falooda is an adaptation of the non-liquid Persian dessert Faloodeh
- a hint of rose syrup with vermicelli and jello and ice cream sprinkled with grounded pistachio
- drinking this liquid dessert through a jumbo straw remind me of Vietnamese iced drink experience!

Royal Lassi ($2.99)
- taste similar to the Royal Falooda but it just a yogurty drink with Rosewater syrup...
- I told my Yelp Friend drink up that's good for him! 

What a ""Royal"" Ending for our November Crawl! 

Until the NEXT one!!

That being said, I think some of the employees are either a little green or just lack the knowledge necessary to fully inform their customers.

I placed a paper order with them after their recommendation to buy larger pieces and then cut them down to the proper size (I had to buy all the tools  necessary for cutting as well). They informed me of the shipping costs and estimated delivery date; I agreed, but was hesitant because it seemed like it wasn't the most optimal choice. 

Upon leaving the store, I visited the website of the paper company they ordered from. Not only can I order custom-cut pieces (at an extra cost of $3!!!), but the delivery (directly to my house) costs less, and is delivered in half the time. 

When the order came in, I brought the cutting supplies with me and returned them. I explained my (completely justified) frustration with the associate working that day. She said she ""didn't know why"" the lady I originally spoke with didn't recommend a custom order and said I should speak with her. That didn't fly with me and I said I wanted my money back for the paper. She spoke with the manager who refused to come out and speak to me face-to-face and without apology, gave me a refund. When I said ""thank you,"" all she said was ""umm, hmm..."" and began to help the next in line. 

Nice. Chances of me stopping by this store again are extremely thin, to say the least. I was clearly upset, but never rude to them. It was a mistake on their part that I wanted corrected.

It's very popular with locals, and is regularly busy, and we found it so on our visit. Dishes were accurate and tasty, but they weren't particularly outstanding. Their risotto lacked moisture, for me, and the pasta was good but not great. It's a very cute little place, though, and the service is very good, so it's worth a visit.

Overall, we said: ""La Bruschetta was a very decent local Italian. I understand why it attracts its loyal following. They have a sound and commendable commitment to serving fresh, local ingredients, but it would be lovely to see more innovation in their dishes, to raise things above ""solid and reliable"". For now, yes go and visit, but I'm not sure you'll be blown away.""","1yjwJdeSbQ-h3zmrJrH92Q",3,"2013-01-23",1,"review",0

All that heralds one of the best Italian restaurants in Edinburgh is an inauspicious burnished red awning just across from Haymarket Station...

The kitchen is full of Italian voices and incredible smells; the restaurant is packed with regulars and locals, some speaking Italian to the wonderful old waiters, some simply enjoying an incredible meal.

Gamberoni with a side of spinacci fills my nostrils and, when I try it, it makes me chew slowly, making the ""I can't believe it's legal to eat this in public"" face.  The chicken dish is, apparently, orgasmic.  Happy faces (and tastebuds!) all round!

The spinacci was so simple and so good that it subsequently launched a google recipe search and repeated trips to Sainsbury's for ingredients over the following months while I perfected it.

I often think that good food allows you to guess at the ingredients but no one ingredient stands out as overpowering the others.  It should create a sensation that's like looking at a piece of art: you don't always see the brush strokes that create the whole piece.  La Bruschetta does this well.  The food made me want to re-learn the language just so I could appreciate all the nuance of it.

Like any (proper) Italian place, they're closed on Sunday and Monday, but it's well worth making a booking for a table at this wonderful wee piece of Italy.","1yjwJdeSbQ-h3zmrJrH92Q",5,"2011-08-25",1,"review",1

We went there ad hoc and were so lucky to have gotten the last table for two in this small restaurant. 
Yes, sadly the table was in the centre of the restaurant surrounded by all the other tables, but in the end, I was so impressed by the food that I totally forgot where I was sitting. It's really not a large place. The restaurant has about 8 tables with 2 tables of 4. Best you make a reservation on the weekend, as they seem very busy, no doubt. The clientele is more of the older upmarket generation with some young ones thrown in, who seem to enjoy a memorable evening out. Maybe for a special occasion, considering that this place is not cheap. Having said this, you definitely get your money worth of quality. 
I ordered a fillet carpaccio with ruccola as a starter, veal in bread crumbs alla milanese (served with capers,  slices of lemon and anchovies) as a main and vanilla ice cream with amaretto as dessert. And yes, I still wonder how I ate it all :-) 
Each of these dishes was served to its highest standards.  I still taste the soft and perfectly cut carpaccio with a hint of lemon or the amaretto touched vanilla ice cream perfectly proportioned. 
The waiters were all Italian and efficient. Yes, we only got a two hours slot, but this was plenty. The food just kept coming. No delays, considering this place was packed. 
The Prosecco was also Italian and of class! Not a brand I normally drink.
I can definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out in general or for a special occasion. 
And what's good? It's just opposite Haymarket.  Easy accessible for everyone!","1yjwJdeSbQ-h3zmrJrH92Q",5,"2016-04-08",1,"review",3

I had to wash some heavy canvas and the extra large machines took them without so much as a shimmy.  Prices are very reasonable- the extra large machine was $4.50/load; Other washers are less.  Dryers are $.25/7 minutes.  So it's a great place to get any kind of washing you need done.  However none of that was what prompted me to write a review.

I accidentally left one of my items in the dryer.  This was a problem because it was stuff for my work and would have been expensive to replace, let alone having to endure remarks about my forgetfulness from coworkers.  One of the employees saw it in the dryer and immediately stored it away for safe keeping.  When I realized I left it there, I called and he knew exactly what I was talking about.  Drove over to pick it up and all problems were solved.

Thanks for the great service!","1KJCoOt2bc0799wmUsgLcw",5,"2013-04-05",1,"review",1

The small dryers are 14 minutes for ($0.25). Bathrooms and tables for sorting are available. Lots of washing supplies available for purchase in coin-op machines. Snack and soda machines too. Some machines were out of service, but still was able to accommodate everyone. Not perfectly clean, but it is still very good.

The Wash Bored gets high marks right off the bat for having an automatic front door.  That may seem trivial, but when I'm carrying bags of laundry along with my detergent and other supplies, it makes a big difference.  I like my laundromat to be thoughtful like that.  

There are two change machines that have never been out when I am there.  They also have vending machines for both laundry supplies and snacks, but the location is also within walking distance of several eateries (Reflections a block down, Isaly's up the road and West View Park Plaza a stone's throw away).  You will also find both a men's and a women's bathroom.  The whole place is kept very clean and tidy.  They have single, double and quad load washers as well as large and small dryers.  Few machines are out of order and I can say from experience that the owners are quick with any refund and a kind note.  Phone numbers are also posted around the Wash Bored should anything go drastically wrong or malfunction so one of the owners can be alerted and take action.  

The prices just went up on the washers earlier this year, but I guess that's unavoidable.  They have a radio but no TV, but I usually end up listening to podcasts on my phone anyway while sitting in a comfy chair at one of the tables.  There are always magazines or papers left around to read as well as the community board where people will post menus, items for sale, services and other miscellaneous community items.  Oh, and I can't forget the coupon exchange, a box full of coupons for the sharing.  Next to the coupon box is a basket of single socks left behind and ""looking for mates.""  Another nice thing they do is $1.50 days - one day of the week when the cost to use one of the smaller washers is only $1.50.  

I recommend this place to anyone who is nearby and looking for a nice laundromat.","1KJCoOt2bc0799wmUsgLcw",5,"2012-03-07",4,"review",1

As you navigate the menu you'll find burgers, sandwiches, salads, sides, shakes, ""Concrete Mixers"", it screams America and Wisconsin in one breath. I ordered the Cheddar (Butter)Burger with Bacon (double of course) value basket with cheese curds. My order was taken quickly and efficiently, and while the place was busy (there were not many available parking spots) we were able to find a seat for 4 people without issue.

We waited a few minutes, but not too long (especially given how busy it was), to receive our food at our table.

If you remember nothing else from this review, CHEESE CURDS. ORDER THEM. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. These little fried balls of joy exist to make people happy. It reminds one of cheese sticks but it straps it to a rocket and enters outer space, the final frontier of good taste. 

The burger was good, I didn't realize when I ordered that for that specific burger you have to ask for lettuce/tomato and other condiments (I'll keep that in mind for next time). It was a good sized burger, the patties were cooked in a way that reminded me of Steak 'n Shake. The bun was fresh. I get the feeling that the cheese is just the highlight of this restaurant. (Remember to order the cheese curds)

I thought the service was good, they have staff in the dining room to take your tray if you're done and deliver food to your table a la Chick-Fil-A. 

Overall, this is a good place with good food and good service (order the cheese curds).","0qTo0ktehcCKsYc5l1NKpg",4,"2013-06-13",0,"review",0
